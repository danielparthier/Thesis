### Slice Preparation
For slices animals (n = XX PV-Cre mice, n = XX ChAT-Cre mice ) were deeply anaesthetised using isoflurane decapitated, the brain removed and quickly transferred to ice-cold slicing solution. sucrose artificial cerebral spinal fluid (SACF). SACF contained 87 NaCl, 26 NaHCO~3~, 10 Glucose, 50 Sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH~2~PO~4~, 0.5 CaCl~2~, 3 MgCl~2~ · 6H~2~O.
400 µm horizontal slices were produced using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany), then transferred and stored in an interface chamber for up to 1-6 h. Slices were perfused with ACSF (119 NaCl, 26 NaHCO~3~, 10 Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH~2~PO~4~, 2.5 CaCl~2~, 1.3 MgCl~2~ · 6H~2~O) and oxygenated during the whole period.

### Slice Recordings
Cells where identified using XXXX DIC XXXX and recorded using a glass electrode filled with intracellular solution (120 K-Gluconate, 10 Hepes, 10 KCl, 5 EGTA, 2 MgSO~4~ · 7H~2~, 3 MgATP, 1 NaGTP, 5 Phosphocreatine Na, 0.2% Biocytin) to record currents, voltage and later identify cells via Biocytin staining.
