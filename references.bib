	abstract = {The hippocampal theta rhythm (rhythmical slow activity, RSA) is one of the most thoroughly studied EEG phenomena. Much of this experimental interest has been stimulated by suggestions that the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus may depend upon thetarelated neuronal activity. Inputs from the medial septal nuclei to the hippocampus were shown to be essential for the theta rhythm in the 1950s, but the role of these basal forebrain projections has not been clearly defined. Four models of the septo-hippocampal connections involved in theta rhythm production are reviewed as the precise roles of these projections are discussed. In our final, consolidated model both cholinergic and GABAergic septal projection cells fire in rhythmic bursts that entrain hippocampal interneurons. The resulting rhythmic inhibition of hippocampal projection cells, together with their excitatory interconnections, generates at least one component of the theta rhythm.},

	abstract = {Medial septal GABAergic neurons of the basal forebrain innervate the hippocampus and related cortical areas, contributing to the coordination of network activity, such as theta oscillations and sharp wave-ripple events, via a preferential innervation of GABAergic interneurons. Individual medial septal neurons display diverse activity patterns, which may be related to their termination in different cortical areas and/or to the different types of innervated interneurons. To test these hypotheses, we extracellularly recorded and juxtacellularly labeled single medial septal neurons in anesthetized rats in vivo during hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations, traced their axons to distant cortical target areas, and analyzed their postsynaptic interneurons. Medial septal GABAergic neurons exhibiting different hippocampal theta phase preferences and/or sharp wave-ripple related activity terminated in restricted hippocampal regions, and selectively targeted a limited number of interneuron types, as established on the basis of molecular markers. We demonstrate the preferential innervation of bistratified cells in CA1 and of basket cells in CA3 by individual axons. One group of septal neurons was suppressed during sharp wave-ripples, maintained their firing rate across theta and non-theta network states and mainly fired along the descending phase of CA1 theta oscillations. In contrast, neurons that were active during sharp wave-ripples increased their firing significantly during “theta” compared to “non-theta” states, with most firing during the ascending phase of theta oscillations. These results demonstrate that specialized septal GABAergic neurons contribute to the coordination of network activity through parallel, target area- and cell type-selective projections to the hippocampus.},

Since the proposal of cognitive maps, the neuroscience of navigation has focused on allocentric (world-referenced) neural representations including place, grid, and head-direction cells. Here, using single-neuron recordings during virtual navigation, we identify “anchor cells” in the human brain as a neural code for egocentric (self-centered) spatial maps: Anchor cells represent egocentric directions towards “anchor points” located in the environmental center or periphery. Anchor cells were abundant in parahippocampal cortex, supported full vectorial representations of egocentric space, and were integrated into a neural memory network. Neurons encoding allocentric direction complemented anchor-cell activity, potentially assisting anchor cells in transforming percepts into allocentric representations. Anchor cells may facilitate egocentric navigation strategies, may support route planning from egocentric viewpoints, and may underlie the first-person perspective in episodic memories.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiological recordings in behaving rodents demonstrate neuronal response properties that may code space and time for episodic memory and goal-directed behaviour. Here, we review recordings from hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex to address the problem of how neurons encode multiple overlapping spatiotemporal trajectories and disambiguate these for accurate memory-guided behaviour. The solution could involve neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that show mixed selectivity, coding both time and location. Some grid cells and place cells that code space also respond selectively as time cells, allowing differentiation of time intervals when a rat runs in the same location during a delay period. Cells in these regions also develop new representations that differentially code the context of prior or future behaviour allowing disambiguation of overlapping trajectories. Spiking activity is also modulated by running speed and head direction, supporting the coding of episodic memory not as a series of snapshots but as a trajectory that can also be distinguished on the basis of speed and direction. Recent data also address the mechanisms by which sensory input could distinguish different spatial locations. Changes in firing rate reflect running speed on long but not short time intervals, and few cells code movement direction, arguing against path integration for coding location. Instead, new evidence for neural coding of environmental boundaries in egocentric coordinates fits with a modelling framework in which egocentric coding of barriers combined with head direction generates distinct allocentric coding of location. The egocentric input can be used both for coding the location of spatiotemporal trajectories and for retrieving specific viewpoints of the environment. Overall, these different patterns of neural activity can be used for encoding and disambiguation of prior episodic spatiotemporal trajectories or for planning of future goal-directed spatiotemporal trajectories.},

Place cells were recorded as medial entorhinal cortex–lesioned rats explored a circular arena during five 16-min sessions comprising a baseline session with all sensory inputs available followed by four sessions during which environmental (i.e. visual, olfactory, tactile) cues were progressively reduced to the point that animals could rely exclusively on self-motion cues to maintain stable place fields. We found that place field stability and a number of place cell firing properties were affected by medial entorhinal cortex lesions in the baseline session. When rats were forced to rely exclusively on self-motion cues, within-session place field stability was dramatically decreased in medial entorhinal cortex rats relative to SHAM rats. These results support a major role of the medial entorhinal cortex in processing self-motion cues, with this information being conveyed to the hippocampus to help anchor and maintain a stable spatial representation during movement.},

All these cells are strongly modulated by theta oscillations, thus suggesting that theta rhythmicity in the MEC may be essential for integrating and coordinating self-movement information during navigation. In this study, we first show that excitotoxic MEC lesions, but not dorsal hippocampal lesions, impair the ability of rats to estimate linear distances based on self-movement information. Next, we report similar deficits following medial septum inactivation, which strongly impairs theta oscillations in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuits. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a major role of the MEC and MS in estimating distances to be traveled, and point to theta oscillations within the MEC as a neural mechanism responsible for the integration of information generated by linear self-displacements.},

	abstract = {Objective: It is well-known that the hippocampus presents significant asymmetry in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that difference in volumes between left and right exists and varies with disease progression. However, few works investigated whether the asymmetry degree of subfields of hippocampus changes through the continuum from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Thus, aim of the present work was to evaluate the Asymmetry Index (AI) of hippocampal substructures as possible MRI biomarkers of Dementia. Moreover, we aimed to assess whether the subfields presented peculiar differences between left and right hemispheres. We also investigated the relationship between the asymmetry magnitude in hippocampal subfields and the decline of verbal memory as assessed by Rey's auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). Methods: Four-hundred subjects were selected from ADNI, equally divided into healthy controls (HC), AD, stable MCI (sMCI), and progressive MCI (pMCI). The structural baseline T1s were processed with FreeSurfer 6.0 and volumes of whole hippocampus (WH) and 12 subfields were extracted. The AI was calculated as: ({\textbar}Left-Right{\textbar}/(Left+Right))*100. ANCOVA was used for evaluating AI differences between diagnoses, while paired t-test was applied for assessing changes between left and right volumes, separately for each group. Partial correlation was performed for exploring relationship between RAVLT summary scores (Immediate, Learning, Forgetting, Percent Forgetting) and hippocampal substructures AI. The statistical threshold was Bonferroni corrected p {\textless} 0.05/13 = 0.0038. Results: We found a general trend of increased degree of asymmetry with increasing severity of diagnosis. Indeed, AD presented the higher magnitude of asymmetry compared with HC, sMCI and pMCI, in the WH (AI mean 5.13 ± 4.29 SD) and in each of its twelve subfields. Moreover, we found in AD a significant negative correlation (r = -0.33, p = 0.00065) between the AI of parasubiculum (mean 12.70 ± 9.59 SD) and the RAVLT Learning score (mean 1.70 ± 1.62 SD). Conclusions: Our findings showed that hippocampal subfields AI varies differently among the four groups HC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. Moreover, we found-for the first time-that hippocampal substructures had different sub-patterns of lateralization compared with the whole hippocampus. Importantly, the severity in learning rate was correlated with pathological high degree of asymmetry in parasubiculum of AD patients.},

However, a quantitative description of the in vivo firing patterns and physiological function of medial septal (MS) cholinergic neurons is still missing. In this study, we combined optogenetics with multi-channel in vivo recording and recorded MS cholinergic neurons' firings in freely behaving male mice for 5.5 - 72 hours. We found that their firing activities were highly correlated with hippocampal theta states. MS cholinergic neurons were highly active during theta-dominant epochs, such as active exploration (AE) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but almost silent during non-theta epochs, such as slow wave sleep (SWS). Interestingly, optogenetic activation of these MS cholinergic neurons during SWS suppressed CA1 ripple oscillations. This suppression could be rescued by muscarinic M2 or M4 receptor antagonists. These results suggest an important physiological function of MS cholinergic neurons: maintaining high hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) level by persistent firing during theta epochs, consequently suppressing ripples and allowing theta oscillations to dominate.Significance StatementThe major source of acetylcholine in the hippocampus comes from the medial septum. Early experiments found that lesions to the MS result in the disappearance of hippocampal theta oscillation, which leads to the speculation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection contributing to theta oscillation. In this paper, by long-term recording of MS cholinergic neurons, we found that they do show theta-state-related firing pattern. However, optogenetically activating these neurons shows little effect on theta rhythm in the hippocampus. Instead, we found that activating MS cholinergic neurons during SWS could suppress hippocampal ripple oscillations. This suppression is mediated by muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors.},

To clarify the role of septal circuits and theta in location-specific activity of place cells and spatial behavior, three drugs were delivered to the medial septum of rats: Tetracaine, a local anesthetic; muscimol, a GABA-A agonist; and gabazine, a GABA-A antagonist. All three drugs disrupted normal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus. However, tetracaine and muscimol both reduced spatial firing and interfered with the rat's ability to navigate to a hidden goal. After gabazine, location-specific firing was preserved in the absence of theta, but rats were unable to accurately locate the hidden goal. These results indicate that theta is unnecessary for location-specific firing of hippocampal cells, and that place cell activity cannot support accurate navigation when septal circuits are disrupted.},

Conversely, we demonstrate these SPW sequences were present in trained rats even after episodic memory was impaired and after other internal sequences – episode field and theta sequences – were eliminated. SPW sequences did not support memory despite continuing to ‘replay’ all task-related sequences – place- field and episode field sequences. Sequence replay occurred selectively during synchronous increases of population excitability – SPWs. Similarly, theta sequences depended on the presence of repeated synchronized waves of excitability – theta oscillations.

Our results indicate that the preferred theta phases of individual neurons are correlated with positive/negative speed modulation and a temporal shift of speed representation in a sub-region/layer and cell type-dependent manner. Most speed cells located in entorhinal cortex layer 2 represented speed prospectively, whereas those in the CA1 and entorhinal cortex layers 3 and 5 represented speed retrospectively. In entorhinal cortex layer 2, putative CA1-projecting pyramidal cells, but not putative dentate gyrus/CA3-projecting stellate cells, represented speed prospectively. Among the hippocampal interneurons, approximately one-third of putative dendrite-targeting (somatostatin-expressing) interneurons, but only a negligible fraction of putative soma-targeting (parvalbumin-expressing) interneurons, showed negative speed modulation. Putative parvalbumin-expressing CA1 interneurons and somatostatin-expressing CA3 interneurons represented speed more retrospectively than parvalbumin-expressing CA3 interneurons.

In contrast, in the right but not left hippocampus, low-theta activity increases during periods of navigation. The frequencies of these hippocampal signals are slower than task-related signals in the neocortex. These results suggest that the human brain includes multiple lateralized oscillatory networks that support different aspects of cognition. Theta oscillations are implicated in memory formation.

Anatomical connections from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC emerge between P4 and P6. Monosynaptic connectivity from PaS and PrS to superficial MEC was measurable from P9 to P10 onward, whereas connectivity with deep MEC was measurable from P11 to P12. From P14/P15 on, reactivity of MEC neurons to parasubicular and presubicular inputs becomes adult-like and continues to develop until P28-P30.

	abstract = {The hippocampus receives two streams of information, spatial and nonspatial, via major afferent inputs from the medial (MEC) and lateral entorhinal cortexes (LEC). The MEC and LEC projections in the temporoammonic pathway are topographically organized along the transverse-axis of area CA1. The potential for functional segregation of area CA1, however, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrated differential novelty-induced c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1 corresponding to topographic projections of MEC and LEC inputs. We found that, while novel place exposure induced a uniform c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1, novel object exposure primarily activated the distal half of CA1 neurons. In hippocampal slices, we observed distinct presynaptic properties between LEC and MEC terminals, and application of either DA or NE produced a largely selective influence on one set of inputs (LEC). Finally, we demonstrated that differential c-Fos expression along the transverse axis of area CA1 was largely abolished by an antagonist of neuromodulatory receptors, clozapine. Our results suggest that neuromodulators can control topographic TA projections allowing the hippocampus to differentially encode new information along the transverse axis of area CA1. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Entorhinal fibers were found to distribute in a proximodistal gradient along the dendrites of dentate granule cells, with afferents from the medial entorhinal area terminating in the innermost portion of the entorhinal synaptic field, afferents from the lateral entorhinal area terminating in the most superficial portions of the entorhinal synaptic field, and intermediate medio-lateral locations in the entorhinal area terminating in intermediate loca tions in the entorhinal synaptic zone. A similar graded pattern of termination of medial and lateral entorhinal fibers was apparent in the very slight crossed projection of the entorhinal area to the contralateral dentate gyrus. In addition, a comparable gradient in the pattern of termination of entorhinal fibers was evident in the entorhinal projection field in the distal dendritic regions of the pyramidal cells of regio inferior of the hippocampus proper. Entorhinal projections to regio superior were, however, organized in quite a different fashion. In this zone, there was no evidence of a proximo-distal gradient in the patterns of termination of medial and lateral entorhinal areas along the dendrites of regio superior pyramidal cells. Rather, the medio-lateral organization was in a longitudinal dimension, with medial entorhinal afferents terminating in the portions of regio superior near the CA1-CA2 transition, and lateral entorhinal afferents terminating furthest from the CA1-CA2 transition, immediately adjacent to the CA1-subicular transition, and in the molecular layer of the subiculum proper. A comparable longitudinal organization of entorhinal projections to regio superior was also evident in the zones of termination of the crossed temporo-ammonic tract, contralateral to the injection. These results demonstrate a heretofore unrecognized complexity in the patterns of projection of the entorhinal area to the hippocampal formation, and illustrate that the entorhinal cortex cannot be divided into only two discrete divisions on the basis of the pattern of projection.},

	abstract = {The medial septum and diagonal band (MSDB) are important in spatial learning and memory. On the basis of the excitotoxic damage of GABAergic MSDB neurons, we have recently suggested a role for these neurons in controlling proactive interference. Our study sought to test this hypothesis in different behavioral procedures using a new GABAergic immunotoxin. GABA-transporter-saporin (GAT1-SAP) was administered into the MSDB of male Sprague–Dawley rats. Following surgery, rats were trained in a reference memory water maze procedure for 5 days, followed by a working memory (delayed match to position) water maze procedure. Other rats were trained in a lever-press avoidance procedure after intraseptal GAT1-SAP or sham surgery. Intraseptal GAT1-SAP extensively damaged GABAergic neurons while sparing most cholinergic MSDB neurons. Rats treated with GAT1-SAP were not impaired in acquiring a spatial reference memory, learning the location of the escape platform as rapidly as sham rats. In contrast, GAT1-SAP rats were slower than sham rats to learn the platform location in a delayed match to position procedure, in which the platform location was changed every day. Moreover, GAT1-SAP rats returned to previous platform locations more often than sham rats. In the active avoidance procedure, intraseptal GAT1-SAP impaired extinction but not acquisition of the avoidance response. Using a different neurotoxin and behavioral procedures than previous studies, the results of this study paint a similar picture that GABAergic MSDB neurons are important for controlling proactive interference. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) provides a major input to the hippocampus and is important for spatial memory. Both cholinergic and GABAergic MSDB neurons project to the hippocampus, and nonselective lesions of the MSDB or transections of the septohippocampal pathway impair spatial memory. However, selective lesions of cholinergic MSDB neurons using 192-IgG saporin (SAP) do not impair or only mildly impair spatial memory. Previously, intraseptal kainic acid was found to reduce levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase, a marker of GABAergic neurons, but not to alter the levels of choline acetyltransferase, a marker of cholinergic neurons. The present study further characterized the effects of kainic acid on GABAergic MSDB neurons and examined the effects of intraseptal kainic acid on spatial memory. Saline, kainic acid, SAP, or the combination of kainic acid and SAP was administered into the MSDB of rats. Spatial memory was assessed in an eight-arm radial maze and a water maze. Kainic acid destroyed GABAergic septohippocampal neurons, but spared cholinergic neurons. SAP eliminated MSDB cholinergic neurons, sparing noncholinergic neurons. Coadministration of kainic acid and SAP destroyed GABAergic and cholinergic MSDB neurons. Acquisition of the radial maze task and performance on this task with 4-h delays were unimpaired by intraseptal kainic acid or SAP, but were impaired by coadministration of kainic acid and SAP. Acquisition of the water maze task was unaffected by intraseptal kainic acid, delayed slightly by SAP, and impaired severely by coadministration of kainic acid and SAP. These results provide evidence that kainic acid at appropriate concentrations effectively destroys GABAergic septohippocampal neurons, while sparing cholinergic MSDB neurons. Furthermore, lesions of the GABAergic septohippocampal neurons do not impair spatial memory. While lesions of cholinergic MSDB neurons may mildly impair spatial memory, the combined lesion of GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons resulted in a memory impairment that was greater than that observed after a selective lesion to either population. Thus, damage of GABAergic or cholinergic MSDB neurons, which together comprise the majority of the septohippocampal pathway, cannot totally account for the spatial memory impairment that is observed after nonselective lesions of the MSDB.

Emerging evidence suggests that they are involved in regulating brain plasticity. However, the expression of PNNs varies between and within brain areas. A lack of quantitative studies describing the distribution and cell-specificity of PNNs makes it difficult to reveal the functional roles of PNNs. In the current study, we examine the distribution of PNNs and the identity of PNN-enwrapped neurons in three brain areas with different cognitive functions: the dorsal hippocampus, medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) and primary visual cortex (V1). We compared rats and mice as knowledge from these species are often intermingled. The most abundant expression of PNNs was found in the mEC and V1, while dorsal hippocampus showed strikingly low levels of PNNs, apart from dense expression in the CA2 region. In hippocampus we also found apparent species differences in expression of PNNs. While we confirm that the PNNs enwrap parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons in V1, we found that they mainly colocalize with excitatory CamKII-expressing neurons in CA2. In mEC, we demonstrate that in addition to PV+ cells, the PNNs colocalize with reelin-expressing stellate cells. We also show that the maturation of PNNs in mEC coincides with the formation of grid cell pattern, while PV+ cells, unlike in other cortical areas, are present from early postnatal development. Finally, we demonstrate considerable effects on the number of PSD-95-gephyrin puncta after enzymatic removal of PNNs.},

	abstract = {Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are closely associated with parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons, and play a major role in controlling developmental neural plasticity. Considering the recent advances in classification of PV+ neurons, here we aimed to clarify whether PNNs might be associated with specific subclasses of PV+ neurons in the hippocampus. In this study, we labeled PNNs by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and classified PV+ neurons based on the combination of cellular location, molecular expression (neuropeptide Y [NPY], somatostatin [SOM], special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 [SATB1]), and retrograde tracing through stereotaxic injection of Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the medial septum. The criteria of each subclass can be summarized as follows: axo-axonic cells, PV+/SATB1–/NPY– cells in the stratum pyramidale; basket cells, PV+/SATB1+/NPY– cells in the stratum pyramidale; bistratified cells, PV+/SATB1+/NPY+ cells in the stratum pyramidale; oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) cells, PV+/SOM+/FG– cells in the stratum oriens; hippocampo-septal projection (H-S) cells, and PV+/SOM+/FG+ cells in the stratum oriens. The ratios of formation of WFA+ PNNs around each subclass of PV+ neurons were estimated according to the optical disector principle. The vast majority (over 90\%) of putative PV+ basket cells were surrounded by PNNs, while only a minor population (less than 10\%) of putative PV+ axo-axonic, O-LM, and H-S cells were enwrapped with PNNs. The ratios of formation of PNNs around putative PV+ bistratified cells were intermediate (25–50\%). These findings indicate that PNNs may be specifically associated with PV+ basket cells, and also provide a key to understand the functional significance of PNNs and PV+ neurons in the hippocampus. J.

Electrophysiologically, several classes of neurons have been described in the MSDB, but their chemical identity remains to be fully established. By combining electrophysiology with single-cell RT-PCR, we have identified four classes of neurons in the MSDB in vitro. The first class displayed slow-firing and little or no Ih, and expressed choline acetyl-transferase mRNA (ChAT). The second class was fast-firing, had a substantial Ih and expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 mRNA (GAD67), sometimes co-localized with ChAT mRNAs. A third class exhibited fast- and burst-firing, had an important Ih and expressed GAD67 mRNA also occasionally co-localized with ChAT mRNAs. The ionic mechanism underlying the bursts involved a low-threshold spike and a prominent Ih current, conductances often associated with pacemaker activity. Interestingly, we identified a fourth class that expressed transcripts solely for one or two of the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2), but not ChAT or GAD. Some putative glutamatergic neurons displayed electrophysiological properties similar to ChAT-positive slow-firing neurons such as the occurrence of a very small Ih, but nearly half of glutamatergic neurons exhibited cluster firing with intrinsically generated voltage-dependent subthreshold membrane oscillations. Neurons belonging to each of the four described classes were found among septohippocampal neurons by retrograde labelling. We provide results suggesting that slow-firing cholinergic, fast-firing and burst-firing GABAergic, and cluster-firing glutamatergic neurons, may each uniquely contribute to hippocampal rhythmicity in vivo.},

	abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band complex is composed predominantly of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, and it projects to the hippocampal formation. A proportion of the GABAergic neurons contain parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein that has previously been localized in fast-spiking, non-accommodating GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum. The aim of the present study was to determine whether parvalbumin is localized preferentially in a similar electrophysiological class of neuron in the medial septum/diagonal band complex. The study was carried out using in vitro intracellular recording, intracellular biocytin filling and parvalbumin immunocytochemistry. Three main classes of neurons were identified according to standard criteria: burst-firing, slow-firing and fast-firing neuronal populations. The fast-firing neurons were subdivided into two subpopulations based on whether or not they displayed accommodation. The fast-spiking, non-accommodating cells were furthermore found to be spontaneously active at resting potentials, and to possess action potentials of significantly (P{\textless}0.05) shorter duration (half width: 0.61±0.12ms) than those of the regular-spiking, accommodating neurons (1.0±0.34ms). Of the neurons that were successfully filled with biocytin and processed for parvalbumin immunoreactivity, 82\% of the fast-spiking, non-accommodating cells possessed parvalbumin immunoreactivity, while none of the regular-spiking, accommodating neurons were found to be immunoreactive for parvalbumin. The slow-firing neurons, shown previously to be cholinergic, did not stain for parvalbumin immunoreactivity, in agreement with studies showing parvalbumin to be localized solely in GABAergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex.In conclusion, these findings suggest the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex that generate high-frequency, non-adaptive discharge. This property correlates with the localization of parvalbumin in these neurons, which suggests that parvalbumin fulfils the same role in the medial septum/diagonal band complex that it does in other parts of the brain. The fast-spiking neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex may play an essential role in the GABAergic influence of the septum on the hippocampal formation.},

Hippocamposeptal neurons provide direct inhibitory feedback from the hippocampus onto septal cells, and are therefore likely to also play an important role in the circuit; these neurons fire at either low or high frequency, reflecting hippocampal network activity during theta oscillations or ripple events, respectively. Here, we optogenetically target the long-range GABAergic projection from the hippocampus to the medial septum in rats, and thereby simulate hippocampal input onto downstream septal cells in an acute slice preparation. In response to optogenetic activation of hippocamposeptal fibers at theta and ripple frequencies, we elicit postsynaptic GABAergic responses in a subset (24\%) of septal cells, most predominantly in fast-spiking cells. In addition, in another subset of septal cells (19\%) corresponding primarily to cholinergic cells, we observe a slow hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a decrease in input resistance, particularly in response to prolonged high-frequency (ripple range) stimulation. This slow response is partially sensitive to GIRK channel and D2 dopamine receptor block. Our results suggest that two independent populations of septal cells distinctly encode hippocampal feedback, enabling the septum to monitor ongoing patterns of activity in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Successful spatial exploration requires gating, storage, and retrieval of spatial memories in the correct order. The hippocampus is known to play an important role in the temporal organization of spatial information. Temporally ordered spatial memories are encoded and retrieved by the firing rate and phase of hippocampal pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons with respect to ongoing network theta oscillations paced by intra- and extrahippocampal areas. Much is known about the anatomical, physiological, and molecular characteristics as well as the connectivity and synaptic properties of various cell types in the hippocampal microcircuits, but how these detailed properties of individual neurons give rise to temporal organization of spatial memories remains unclear. We present a model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit based on observed biophysical properties of pyramidal cells and six types of inhibitory interneurons: axo-axonic, basket, bistratistified, neurogliaform, ivy, and oriens lacunosum-moleculare cells. The model simulates a virtual rat running on a linear track. Excitatory transient inputs come from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and impinge on both the pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, whereas inhibitory inputs from the medial septum impinge only on the inhibitory interneurons. Dopamine operates as a gate-keeper modulating the spatial memory flow to the PC distal dendrites in a frequency-dependent manner. A mechanism for spike-timing-dependent plasticity in distal and proximal PC dendrites consisting of three calcium detectors, which responds to the instantaneous calcium level and its time course in the dendrite, is used to model the plasticity effects. The model simulates the timing of firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to theta oscillations, and proposes functional roles for the different classes of the hippocampal and septal inhibitory interneurons in the correct ordering of spatial memories as well as in the generation and maintenance of theta phase precession of pyramidal cells (place cells) in CA1. The model leads to a number of experimentally testable predictions that may lead to a better understanding of the biophysical computations in the hippocampus and medial septum. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We assessed the anatomical specificity of muscimol intra-MSDB self-administration by injecting this molecule into the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Finally, we evaluated the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in muscimol self-administration. BALB/c mice were implanted with a guide cannula targeting the MSDB or the NAc. They were trained to discriminate between the two arms of a Y-maze, one arm being reinforced by muscimol or bicuculline injections. Another group of MSDB implanted mice was pre-treated intraperitoneally before muscimol self-administration with a D1 (SCH23390) or D2/D3 (sulpiride) receptor antagonist or vehicle. A last group of MSDB mice received additional bilateral guide cannulae targeting the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or a more dorsal region to assess the effects of intra-VTA injection of SCH23390 on intra-MSDB muscimol self-administration. Mice self-administered intra-MSDB muscimol (0.6, 1.2, or 12 ng/50 nl), but not bicuculline (1.5 or 3 ng/50 nl). Systemic pre-treatment with SCH23390 (25 μg/kg) or sulpiride (50 mg/kg) or bilateral injection of SCH23390 (0.25 μg/0.1 μl) into the VTA prevented acquisition of intra-MSDB muscimol self-administration. The activation of GABAA receptors in the MSDB supports self-administration, and dopamine release from the VTA may be involved in the acquisition of this behaviour. The MSDB could represent a common brain substrate for the rewarding properties of drugs facilitating GABAA tone.},

	abstract = {Activation of median raphe serotonergic neurons results in the desynchronization of hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. This could be a direct effect, because serotonin (5-HT) fibers terminate on a specific population of hippocampal interneurons. On the other hand, it could be an indirect action through the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) pacemaker cells, because, in addition to previously described inhibitory effects, excitatory actions of 5-HT have been demonstrated on MSDB γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons through 5-HT2A receptors. Electron microscopic double immunostaining for Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injected into the median raphe (MR) and parvalbumin, choline acetyltransferase, or calretinin as well as double immunostaining for 5-HT and parvalbumin, and colocalization for parvalbumin and 5-HT2A receptors were done in rats. The results demonstrated that: 1) MR axons form perisomatic and peridendritic baskets and asymmetric synaptic contacts on MSDB parvalbumin neurons; 2) these fibers do not terminate on septal cholinergic and calretinin neurons; 3) 5-HT fibers form synapses identical to those formed by PHA-L-immunolabeled axons with parvalbumin neurons; and 4) MSDB parvalbumin cells contain 5-HT2A receptors. These observations indicate that 5-HT has a dual action on the activity of hippocampal principal cells: 1) an inhibition of the input sector by activation of hippocampal GABA neurons that terminate exclusively on apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and 2) a disinhibition of the output sector of principal neurons. MSDB parvalbumin-containing GABAergic neurons specifically innervate hippocampal basket and chandelier cells. Thus, 5-HT-elicited activation of MSDB GABAergic neurons will result in a powerful inhibition of these GABA neurons. J. Comp. Neurol. 410:586–598, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This study investigated the localization of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity in cell bodies of the rat septal complex using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In adjacent sections of the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), the distribution of cell bodies expressing 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was closely related to cells labeled with oligonucleotide probes to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase), VAChT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) or parvalbumin mRNA. Using antiserum to GAD and antibodies to GABA, 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was demonstrated in a majority of GABAergic cells in the MSDB. 5-HT1A receptor-immunoreactive GABAergic cells in the MSDB were also demonstrated to contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, a marker for septohippocampal projecting GABAergic neurons. In the lateral septum, 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was colocalized with the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k, a marker for septal GABAergic somatospiny neurons. 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was also detected in a subpopulation of VAChT-containing cholinergic neurons of the MSDB. In MSDB neurons, colocalization of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivities was demonstrated. These observations suggest that serotonin via 5-HT1A receptors may represent an important modulator of hippocampal transmission important for cognitive and emotional functions through actions on both GABAergic and cholinergic neurons of the rat septal complex. In addition, 5-HT may exert its effects in the MSDB via cells expressing both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.},

To clarify the cellular localization and chemical identity of 5-HT2A receptor-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons in the rat septal complex and dorsal hippocampus, an immunofluorescence histochemical study was performed using a monoclonal antibody to the 5-HT2A receptor. Pretreatment with colchicine increased the number of 5-HT2A receptor-ir cell bodies, indicating that the 5-HT2A receptor protein undergoes microtubule-dependent anterograde transport in axons and dendrites. 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in septal cholinergic neurons, identified with an antiserum to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and in GABAergic cell bodies in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca, identified with antisera to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. In the dorsal hippocampus, 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity was demonstrated in cells located in the pyramidal cell layer (CA1–3) throughout the Ammon's horn and in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity was present in most hippocampal interneurons identified by the presence of GAD65, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28k, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor immunoreactivity was present in only a few interneurons containing cholecystokinin and calretinin immunoreactivity. The results suggest that serotonin acting on 5-HT2A receptors can modulate hippocampal functions via direct actions on hippocampal glutamatergic principal cells and indirectly via actions on hippocampal interneurons with different phenotypes as well as GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons.},

	abstract = {Activity in hippocampal area CA1 is essential for consolidating episodic memories, but it is unclear how CA1 activity patterns drive memory formation. We find that in the hours following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), fast-spiking interneurons (which typically express parvalbumin (PV)) show greater firing coherence with CA1 network oscillations. Post-CFC inhibition of PV+ interneurons blocks fear memory consolidation. This effect is associated with loss of two network changes associated with normal consolidation: (1) augmented sleep-associated delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–12 Hz) and ripple (150–250 Hz) oscillations; and (2) stabilization of CA1 neurons’ functional connectivity patterns. Rhythmic activation of PV+ interneurons increases CA1 network coherence and leads to a sustained increase in the strength and stability of functional connections between neurons. Our results suggest that immediately following learning, PV+ interneurons drive CA1 oscillations and reactivation of CA1 ensembles, which directly promotes network plasticity and long-term memory formation. Episodic memory consolidation requires activity in hippocampal area CA1. Here the authors report that pharmacogenetic inhibition of CA1 PV+ interneuron firing after fear learning blocks memory consolidation and disrupts associated enhancement in network oscillations and stabilization of functional connectivity patterns.},

We report a specialized population of septal GABAergic neurons, the Teevra cells, selectively innervating the hippocampal CA3 area bypassing CA1, CA2, and the dentate gyrus. Parvalbumin-immunopositive Teevra cells show the highest rhythmicity among MS neurons and fire with short burst duration (median, 38 ms) preferentially at the trough of both CA1 theta and slow irregular oscillations, coincident with highest hippocampal excitability. Teevra cells synaptically target GABAergic axo-axonic and some CCK interneurons in restricted septo-temporal CA3 segments. The rhythmicity of their firing decreases from septal to temporal termination of individual axons. We hypothesize that Teevra neurons coordinate oscillatory activity across the septo-temporal axis, phasing the firing of specific CA3 interneurons, thereby contributing to the selection of pyramidal cell assemblies at the theta trough via disinhibition.

(2) A lateral perforant path from the lateral part of the entorhinal area to a superficial zone in the dentate molecular layer and to the superfcial part of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA3. This paper deals specifically with the lateral perforant path. A third group of perforant fibers, bing intermediate to the others with regard to both origin and termination has been noticed in one animal. The fiber-course of the lateral perforant path is found to be identical to that previously described for the medial path. The terminal field is present along the whole axial extent of the hippocampus and fascia dentata, i.e., from the temporal tip to the subsplenial portion. No sings of degeneration corresponding to the so-called alvear path were observed following lesions of either the medial or the lateral part of the entorhinal cortex.

We questioned whether the long‐range outputs from HF‐PHR to RSC in Long Evans rats develop during the same time periods as previously reported for the intrinsic HF‐PHR connectivity and the projections from RSC to HF‐PHR. The results of a series of retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments in rats of different postnatal ages show that the postnatal projections from HF‐PHR to RSC display low densities around birth, but develop during the first postnatal week, reaching adult‐like densities around the time of eye‐opening. Developing projections display a topographical organization similar to adult projections. We conclude that the long‐range projections from HF‐PHR to RSC develop in parallel with the intrinsic circuitry of HF‐PHR and the projections of RSC to HF‐PHR. Hippocampal formation, parahippocampal region (HF‐PHR), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are functionally dependent.

The results demonstrate that both areas have several similar afferent connections, particularly those from subcortical areas such as the claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, anterior thalamus, nucleus reuniens, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. Both subicular areas also are innervated by axons originating in the ipsilateral and contralateral entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. In contrast to these similarities, most axons innervating the presubiculum originate in the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, the claustrum, and the contralateral presubiculum. Conversely, the parasubiculum is innervated primarily by axons that originate in area CA1 of the hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum. The major efferent projection from the presubiculum and parasubiculum courses bilaterally to the medial entorhinal cortex; however, the results of the present study confirm previous suggestions that presubicular axons terminate almost exclusively in layers I and III, whereas parasubicular axons innervate layer II. The presubiculum also projects to the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral ventral portion of the medial mammillary nucleus, whereas the parasubiculum projects prominently to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum, and the lateral dorsal segment of the medial mammillary nucleus. Thus despite some similarities, the major connections of presubiculum and parasubiculum are distinct from one another and distinct from the projections of the adjacent subiculum and postsubiculum. These results suggest that the subicular cortex is considerably more complex than previously envisioned and indicate that each segment may subserve a distinct role in the processing of information by the hippocampal formation.},

The goal of the present investigation was to determine if these two pathways might originate from different cell populations within the entorhinal area. The cells of origin of these entorhinal pathways were identified by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Injections which labeled the entorhinal terminal fields in both the fascia dentata and regio superior resulted in the retrograde labeling of two populations of cells in the entorhinal area. Ipsilateral to the injection, HRP reaction product was found in the cells of layer II (predominantly stellate cells) and the cells of layer III (predominantly pyramidal cells). Contralateral to the injections, however, the reaction product was found almost exclusively in the cells of layer III. With selective injections of the entorhinal terminal field in regio superior, only the cells of layer III were labeled, but these were labeled bilaterally. Selective injection of the entorhinal terminal field in the fascia dentata, however, resulted in the labeling of cells of layer II, but not of layer III, and these cells of layer II were labeled almost exclusively ipsilaterally. A very small number of labeled cells in layer II were, however, found contralateral to the injection as well. No labeled cells were found either in the presubiculum or parasubiculum following injections of the hippocampal formation. These cell populations were found capable of retrograde transport of HRP, however, since cells in both presubiculum and parasubiculum were labeled following HRP injections into the contralateral entorhinal area. These results suggest that the projections to the fascia dentata originate from the cells of layer II, while the projections to regio superior originate from the cells of layer III of the entorhinal region proper. The very slight crossed projection from the entorhinal area to the contralateral area dentata probably originates from the small population of cells in layer II which are labeled following HRP injections in the contralateral area dentata.},

In this study we examined the difference of the multisynaptic inputs to the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus (DG) in the rat by using retrograde trans-synaptic tracing of recombinant rabies virus vectors. Three days after the vectors were injected into the dorsal or ventral DG, monosynaptic neuronal labeling was present in the entorhinal cortex, medial septum, diagonal band, and supramammillary nucleus, each of which is known to project to the DG directly. As in previous tracing studies, topographical patterns related to the dorsal and ventral DG were seen in these regions. Five days after infection, more of the neurons in these regions were labeled and labeled neurons were also seen in cortical and subcortical regions, including the piriform and medial prefrontal cortices, the endopiriform nucleus, the claustrum, the cortical amygdala, the medial raphe nucleus, the medial habenular nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the lateral septum. As in the monosynaptically labeled regions, a topographical distribution of labeled neurons was evident in most of these disynaptically labeled regions. These data indicate that the cortical and subcortical inputs to the dorsal and ventral DG are conveyed through parallel disynaptic pathways. This second-order input difference in the dorsal and ventral DG is likely to contribute to the functional differentiation of the hippocampus along the dorsoventral axis.},

Despite the involvement of the BF cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in olfaction related memory has been reported, the underlying neural circuits remain poorly understood. Here, we combined viral trans-synaptic tracing systems and ChAT-cre transgenic mice to systematically reveal the relationship between the olfactory system and the different subsets of BFCNs. The retrograde adeno-associated virus and rabies virus (AAV-RV) tracing showed that different subregional BFCNs received diverse inputs from multiple olfactory cortices. The cholinergic neurons in medial and caudal horizontal diagonal band Broca (HDB), magnocellular preoptic area (MCPO) and ventral substantia innominate (SI; hereafter HMS complex, HMSc) received the inputs from the entire olfactory system such as the olfactory bulb (OB), anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), entorhinal cortex (ENT), basolateral amygdala and especially the piriform cortex (PC) and hippocampus (HIP); while medial septum (MS/DB) and a part of rostral HDB (hereafter MS/DB complex, MS/DBc), predominantly from HIP; and nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM) and dorsal SI (hereafter NBM complex, NBMc), mainly from the central amygdala. The anterograde vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) tracing further validated that the major target of the OB to the BF is HMSc. To correlate these structural relations between the BFCNs and olfactory functions, the neurons activated in the BF during olfaction related task were mapped with c-fos immunostaining. It was found that some of the BFCNs were activated in go/no-go olfactory discrimination task, but with different activated patterns. Interestingly, the BFCNs in HMSc were more significantly activated than the other subregions. Therefore, our data have demonstrated that among the different subgroups of BFCNs, HMSc is more closely related to the olfactory system, both structurally and functionally. This work provides the evidence for distinct roles of different subsets of BFNCs in olfaction associated memory.},

Extracellularly recording and labeling GABAergic entorhinal-projecting neurons in awake behaving mice show that these subcortical neurons, named orchid cells, fire in long rhythmic bursts during immobility and locomotion. Orchid cells discharge near the peak of hippocampal and entorhinal theta oscillations, couple to entorhinal gamma oscillations, and target subpopulations of extra-hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Thus, orchid cells are a specialized source of rhythmic subcortical GABAergic modulation of 'upstream' and 'downstream' cortico-cortical circuits involved in mnemonic functions.},

To engage Fos production, rats first performed a radial arm maze task that is severely disrupted by bilateral fornix lesions. Using immunohistochemical techniques, Fos-positive cells were visualized and counted in 39 sites in both hemispheres. Fornix lesions led to a significant reduction in Fos in all ipsilateral hippocampal subfields, as well as the entorhinal cortex and most of the subicular complex. Other sites that showed reduced activity included the ipsilateral retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and postrhinal cortices. Subcortical regions showing significant Fos decreases included the anterior thalamic nuclei, supramammillary nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, and lateral septum. Thus, the effects of fornix lesions extended beyond the hippocampal formation and included sites not directly innervated by the tract. These changes were nevertheless selective, as shown by the lack of hemispheric difference in any of the preselected control sites, the perirhinal cortex, or nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, there were no hemispheric differences in an additional group of animals with unilateral fornix lesions that were killed directly from the home cage. The location of Fos changes closely corresponded to those brain regions that when lesioned disrupt spatial working memory. Moreover, there was a correspondence between those brain regions that show increased Fos production in normal animals performing the radial arm maze task and those affected by fornix lesions. These results show that fornix transection has widespread, but selective, effects on a network of structures normally activated by spatial memory processes, with these effects extending beyond the hippocampal formation.},

In both experiments, tasks were matched for sensorimotor factors but differed in their spatial and mnemonic demands. In Experiment 1, matched groups of rats either ran in a standard eight-arm radial maze or ran up and down just one arm of the maze while the number of runs and rewards were matched across pairs of rats. In Experiment 2, both groups were trained on the eight-arm radial maze but in different rooms. On the test day, one group was moved so that both groups now performed the same radial-maze task in the same room but for one group the extramaze cues were novel. There were significant increases in Fos in all three of the anterior thalamic nuclei (anterodorsal, anteroventral and anteromedial) as well as the adjacent nucleus reuniens and rostral reticular thalamic nucleus, in both the eight-arm versus one-arm condition (Experiment 1) and the novel room versus familiar room condition (Experiment 2). There were no significant differences in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in either experiment. The more spatially demanding task in each experiment also resulted in increased Fos expression in the subicular complex (postsubiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum), as well as in the prelimbic cortex. Performing the standard radial-arm maze task also produced significant Fos increases in both rostral and caudal levels of the retrosplenial cortex when compared to rats running up and down a single arm in the same maze (Experiment 1); performing the task in a novel room did not, however, result in any further Fos increases in this region (Experiment 2). The specificity of the changes in levels of Fos was shown by a lack of any consistent difference in levels in six control sites.The present results reveal a group of anatomically related structures that work together in the intact rat brain during tasks that tax allocentric spatial working memory.},

After obstacle exercise training, the VO2 measured during treadmill running with obstacles decreased significantly. Obstacle exercise-induced c-Fos expressions and dopamine turnover (DOPAC/dopamine) in the septum after obstacle exercise training were significantly higher than that before training. The dopamine turnover was correlated with exercise efficiency on the 3rd day after exercise training. Furthermore, the training effect on exercise efficiency was significantly decreased by injection of dopamine receptor antagonists into the septum and was associated with decreased c-Fos expressions in the septum and hippocampus of the mice. These results suggest that dopaminergic function in the septum is involved in exercise efficiency during continuous complicated exercises.},

However, the relative influence of these neurons on behavior-linked neural processing in the two cortical areas remains unclear. We have now examined the effect of destruction of the cholinergic neurons with microinjection of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum on the induction of c-Fos protein, an index of neuronal synaptic excitation, in the two forebrain areas to varied episodic experiences. Separate groups of rats were (a) re-exposed to the laboratory where they had previously undergone a surgery for intraseptal microinjection or (b) exposed to a novel environment. Re-exposure evoked a differential increase in the number of c-Fos positive neurons in dorsal CA1 compared to novelty, while a robust increase was observed in the Cg selectively in the novel environment. Both the differential and the selective increases were strongly attenuated by the cholinergic destruction with intraseptal-immunotoxin. These findings suggest that the cholinergic modulation of the neural processing in the two forebrain areas varies partly in an environment-dependent fashion affecting CA1 neural activation on repeat exposure to an environment where they had a relatively complex aversive experience while favoring Cg neural activation more during novelty.},

Since not all vigilance states have been studied, we evaluated cholinergic neuronal activation levels across spontaneously occurring states of vigilance, as well as during sleep deprivation and recovery sleep following sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation was performed for 2h at the beginning of the light (inactive) period, by means of gentle sensory stimulation. In the rodent BF, we used immunohistochemical detection of the c-Fos protein as a marker for activation, combined with labeling for choline acetyl-transferase (ChAT) as a marker for cholinergic neurons. We found c-Fos activation in BF cholinergic neurons was highest in the group undergoing sleep deprivation (12.9\% of cholinergic neurons), while the spontaneous wakefulness group showed a significant increase (9.2\%), compared to labeling in the spontaneous sleep group (1.8\%) and a sleep deprivation recovery group (0.8\%). A subpopulation of cholinergic neurons expressed c-Fos during spontaneous wakefulness, when possible confounds of the sleep deprivation procedure were minimized (e.g., stress and sensory stimulation). Double-labeling in the sleep deprivation treatment group was significantly elevated in select subnuclei of the BF (medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, and the magnocellular preoptic nucleus), when compared to spontaneous wakefulness. These findings support and provide additional confirming data of previous reports that cholinergic neurons of BF play a role in vigilance state regulation by promoting wakefulness.},

	abstract = {In the diurnal unstriped Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) access to a running wheel can trigger a shift in active phase preference, with some individuals becoming night-active (NA), while others continue to be day-active (DA). To investigate the contributions of different neural systems to the support of this shift in locomotor activity, we investigated the association between chronotype and Fos expression during the day and night in three major nuclei in the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic (ACh) arousal system – medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal band of Broca (VDB and HDB respectively) −, and whether neural activation in these areas was related to neural activity in the orexinergic system. We also measured Fos expression in dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells of two components of the reward system that also participate in arousal – the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and supramammillary nucleus (SUM). NAs and DAs were compared to animals with no wheels. NAs had elevated Fos expression at night in ACh cells, but only in the HDB. In the non-cholinergic cells of the BF of NAs, enhanced nocturnal Fos expression was almost universally seen, but only associated with activation of the orexinergic system for the MS/VDB region. For some of the areas and cell types of the BF, the patterns of Fos expression of DAs appeared similar to those of NAs, but were never associated with activation of the orexinergic system. Also common to DAs and NAs was a general increase in Fos expression in non-dopaminergic cells of the SUM and anterior VTA. Thus, in this diurnal species, voluntary exercise and a shift to a nocturnal chronotype changes neural activity in arousal and reward areas of the brain known to regulate a broad range of neural functions and behaviors, which may be also affected in human shift workers.},

	abstract = {Extensive evidence indicates that the septum plays a predominant role in fear learning, yet the direction of this control is still a matter of debate. Increasing data suggest that the medial (MS) and lateral septum (LS) would be differentially required in fear conditioning depending on whether a discrete conditional stimulus (CS) predicts, or not, the occurrence of an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Here, using a tone CS-US pairing (predictive discrete CS, context in background) or unpairing (context in foreground) conditioning procedure, we show, in mice, that pretraining inactivation of the LS totally disrupted tone fear conditioning, which, otherwise, was spared by inactivation of the MS. Inactivating the LS also reduced foreground contextual fear conditioning, while sparing the higher level of conditioned freezing to the foreground (CS-US unpairing) than to the background context (CS-US pairing). In contrast, inactivation of the MS totally abolished this training-dependent level of contextual freezing. Interestingly, inactivation of the MS enhanced background contextual conditioning under the pairing condition, whereas it reduced foreground contextual conditioning under the unpairing condition. Hence, the present findings reveal a functional dissociation between the LS and the MS in Pavlovian fear conditioning depending on the predictive value of the discrete CS. While the requirement of the LS is crucial for the appropriate processing of the tone CS-US association, the MS is crucial for an appropriate processing of contextual cues as foreground or background information.},

In the present study, we have investigated whether the effects of cholinergic activation of SuM on hippocampal and cortical neural activities involve a cooperative interaction with the medial septum (MS). Microinjection of the broad-spectrum cholinergic agonist, carbachol, or the cholinergic-nicotinic receptor agonist, nicotine, into the lSuM and the mSuM in urethane anesthetized rat evoked a similar pattern of hippocampal theta rhythm. Despite that, only the lSuM microinjections resulted in an increase in expression of c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-Fos-ir) in neurons, including interneurons, of the ipsilateral hippocampus with a very dense expression in dentate gyrus. Likewise, a robust induction of c-Fos-ir was also observed in the ipsilateral Cg. Inhibition of the MS with muscimol pre-treatment attenuated both carbachol-evoked c-Fos-ir and theta activation. The findings indicate that cholinergic–nicotinic mechanisms in lSuM evoke not only neural activation via the ascending synchronizing pathway but also an MS-modulated expression of the plasticity-related molecule c-Fos in cortical regions that are strongly innervated by the lSuM.},

Cognitive impairments commonly occur in Parkinson's disease. Here we performed behavioral, electrophysiological, neurochemical and immunohistochemical studies in rats with complete unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to assess the importance of dopamine (DA) depletion and MS-DB 5-HT2A receptors for working memory. The MFB lesions resulted in working memory impairment and decreases in firing rate and density of MS-DB PV-positive neurons, peak frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm, and DA levels in septohippocampal system and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to control rats. Intra-MS-DB injection of high affinity 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 enhanced working memory, increased firing rate of PV-positive neurons and peak frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm, elevated DA levels in the hippocampus and mPFC, and decreased 5-HT level in the hippocampus in control and lesioned rats. Compared to control rats, the duration of the excitatory effect produced by TCB-2 on the firing rate of PV-positive neurons was markedly shortened in lesioned rats, indicating dysfunction of 5-HT2A receptors. These findings suggest that unilateral lesions of the MFB in rats induced working memory deficit, and activation of MS-DB 5-HT2A receptors enhanced working memory, which may be due to changes in the activity of septohippocampal network and monoamine levels in the hippocampus and mPFC.},

In this study, we examined changes in the theta-related firing activity of PV-positive neurons in the MS-DB, their response to 5-HT1A receptor stimulation and the corresponding hippocampal theta rhythm, and the density of PV-positive neurons and their co-localization with 5-HT1A receptors in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The lesion of the SNc decreased the rhythmically bursting activity of PV-positive neurons and the peak frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm. Systemic administration of 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.5-128 µg/kg, i.v.) inhibited the firing rate of PV-positive neurons and disrupted rhythmically bursting activity of the neurons and the theta rhythm in sham-operated and the lesioned rats, respectively. The cumulative doses producing inhibition and disruption in the lesioned rats were higher than that of sham-operated rats. Furthermore, local application of 8-OH-DPAT (0.005 μg) in the MS-DB also inhibited the firing rate of PV-positive neurons and disrupted their rhythmically bursting activity in sham-operated rats, while having no effect on PV-positive neurons in the lesioned rats. The lesion of the SNc decreased the density of PV-positive neurons in the MS-DB, and percentage of PV-positive neurons expressing 5-HT1A receptors. These results indicate that the lesion of the SNc leads to suppression of PV-positive neurons in the MS-DB and hippocampal theta rhythm. Furthermore, the lesion decreases the response of these neurons to 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, which attributes to dysfunction and/or down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression on these neurons. These changes may be involved in cognitive impairments of Parkinson's disease.},

These findings might be explained by an action of 8-OH-DPAT on 5-HT1A receptors located on cholinergic neurons which the drug could transiently hyperpolarise. If so, selective damage of these neurons should mimic the effects of 8-OH-DPAT, or, at least, synergistically interfere with them. To test this hypothesis, rats were subjected to intraseptal infusions of 8-OH-DPAT (or phosphate-buffered saline) during acquisition of a water maze task before and/or after 192 IgG-saporin-induced MS cholinergic lesion (vs. sham-operated). We confirmed that only pre-acquisition intraseptal 8-OH-DPAT infusions prevented learning and subsequent drug-free retrieval of the platform location in intact rats and found that (1) the cholinergic lesion did not prevent recall of the platform location, and (2) the impairing effects of 8-OH-DPAT were similar in sham-operated and lesioned rats, whether naïve or not, to the task before lesion surgery. An action of 8-OH-DPAT on only MS cholinergic neurons is not sufficient to account for the drug-induced memory impairments. A concomitant 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperpolarisation of cholinergic and/or GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons (intact rats), or of only GABAergic and/or glutamatergic ones after cholinergic lesion, might be necessary to obliterate task acquisition, confirming that, in the MS, (1) the three neuronal populations could cooperate to process hippocampal-dependent information, and (2) non-cholinergic septohippocampal neurons might be more important than cholinergic ones in serotonin-induced modulation of hippocampus-dependent memory processing.},

The medial septum (MS) plays an important role in the control and coordination of theta activity, as well as in the modulation of learning. It has been established that increased serotonergic activity may desynchronize theta activity, while reduced serotonergic activity produces continuous and persistent theta activity in the hippocampus. We investigate whether serotonin acting on the medial septum could modify spatial learning and the functional relationship between septo-hippocampal and septo-mammillary theta activity. The serotonin was depleted (5HT-D) from the medial septum by the injection of 5,7 DHT (5,7- dihydroxytryptamine). Theta activity was recorded in the dorsal hippocampus, MS and mammillary nuclei (SUM, MM) of Sprague-Dawley male rats during spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Spatial learning was facilitated, and the frequency of the hippocampal theta activity during the first days of training increased (to 8.5Hz) in the 5HT-D group, unlike the vehicle group. Additionally, the coherence between the MS-hippocampus and the MS-mammillary nuclei was higher during the second day of the test compared to the vehicle group. We demonstrated that septal serotonin depletion facilitates the acquisition of spatial information in association with a higher functional coupling of the medial septum with the hippocampus and mammillary nuclei. Serotonin, acting in the medial septum, modulates hippocampal theta activity and spatial learning.},

The receptor’s localization in the different neuronal subtypes, which may be of importance for understanding its role in neuronal circuitries, is, however, unknown. In this study we show by immunocytochemical double-labeling techniques, that the 5-HT1A receptor is present on both pyramidal and principal cells, and calbindin- and parvalbumin-containing neurons, which generally define two different subtypes of interneurons. Moreover, semiquantitative analysis showed that the receptor’s distribution in the different neuronal types varies between brain areas. In cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala the receptor was located on both principal cells and calbindin- and parvalbumin-containing neurons. In septum and thalamus, the receptor was mostly present on calbindin- and parvalbumin-containing cells. Especially in the medial septum and thalamic reticular nucleus, the receptor highly colocalized with parvalbumin-positive neurons. These results suggest a diverse function of the 5-HT1A receptor in modulating neuronal circuitry in different brain areas, that may depend on the type of neuron the receptor is predominantly located on.},

Peptidergic perikarya and fibers had an extensive distribution: they were densest in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and infralimbic cortex, of intermediate density in the medial septal area and of lowest density in the dorsal and caudal lateral septal nucleus. Somatostatin-like immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were generally more numerous than the neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive ones, but more faintly labeled. Their pattern of distribution was strikingly similar in some of the limbic structures studied but clearly distinct in others. Excellent overlap of neuropeptide Y and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was detected in: (1) the medial septal area, where innervation occasionally formed perivascular clusters; (2) the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, characterized by dense patchy innervation; and (3) the laterodorsal septal nucleus, scarcely innervated. In the latter structures, most peptidergic neurons were double-labeled. On the other hand, both peptidergic innervations clearly differed in the lateroventral septal nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis which contained distinct clusters of somatostatin-like immunoreactive neurons devoid of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity. Also, the perineuronal and peridendritic axonal plexuses (‘woolly fibers’) present in these structures were only labeled with somatostatin. In the infralimbic cortex, the relation between the peptides varied according to the cortical laminae. Coexistence of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y frequently occurred in layer VI and in the subcortical white matter, whereas layer V and particularly layers II and III contained a contingent of neurons labeled only with somatostatin. Dense horizontal terminal networks in layers I and VI however were similar for both peptides.These findings support the existence of two different types of somatostatin-like immunoreactive perikarya as regards colocalization with neuropeptide Y. Their particular topographical segregation within the cortical and subcortical structures analysed suggest that they could have different connections and functional properties. This finding is of pathophysiological importance in Alzheimer's dementia in which cortical somatostatin content has been reported to be decreased but not neuropeptide Y, suggesting that double-labeled somatostatin-neuropeptide Y neurons might be relatively spared in this neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, the finding of somatostatin woolly fibers in the human bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and ventral pallidum, not previously described in lower species, raises the question of phylogenetic modifications in this part of the limbic system.},

	abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBB) is crucial for hippocampal theta rhythm generation (4-12 Hz). However, the mechanisms behind theta rhythmogenesis are still under debate. The MS/DBB consists, in its majority, of three neuronal populations that use acetylcholine, GABA, or glutamate as neurotransmitter. While the firing patterns of septal neurons enable the MS/DBB to generate rhythmic output critical for the generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, the ability to synchronize these action potentials is dependent on the interconnectivity between the three major MS/DBB neuronal populations, yet little is known about intraseptal connections. Here we assessed the connectivity between pairs of MS/DBB neurons with paired patch-clamp recordings. We found that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons provide intraseptal connections and produce sizable currents in MS/DBB postsynaptic cells. We also analyzed linear and nonlinear relationships between the action potentials fired by pairs of neurons belonging to various MS/DBB neuronal populations. Our results show that while the synchrony index for action potential firing was significantly higher in pairs of GABAergic neurons, coherence of action potential firing in the theta range was similarly low in all pairs analyzed. Recurrence analysis demonstrated that individual action potentials were more recurrent in cholinergic neurons than in other cell types. Implementing sparse connectivity in a computer model of the MS/DBB network reproduced our experimental data. We conclude that the interplay between the intrinsic membrane properties of different MS/DBB neuronal populations and the connectivity among these populations underlie the ability of the MS/DBB network to critically contribute to hippocampal theta rhythmogenesis.},

	abstract = {The parahippocampal region is thought to be critical for memory and spatial navigation. Within this region lies the parasubiculum, a small structure that exhibits strong theta modulation, contains functionally specialized cells, and projects to layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Thus, it is uniquely positioned to influence firing of spatially modulated cells in the MEC and play a key role in the internal representation of the external environment. However, the basic neuronal composition of the parasubiculum remains largely unknown, and its border with the MEC is often ambiguous. We combine electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in adult mice (both sexes) to define first, the boundaries of the parasubiculum, and second, the major cell types found in this region. We find distinct differences in the colabeling of molecular markers between the parasubiculum and the MEC, allowing us to clearly separate the two structures. Moreover, we find distinct distribution patterns of different molecular markers within the parasubiculum, across both superficial-deep and DV axes. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, we find that neurons in the parasubiculum can be broadly separated into three clusters based on their electrophysiological properties, and that each cluster corresponds to a different molecular marker. We demonstrate that, while the parasubiculum aligns structurally to some to general cortical principals, it also shows divergent features in particular in contrast to the MEC. This work will form an important basis for future studies working to disentangle the circuitry underlying memory and spatial navigation functions of the parasubiculum.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We identify the major neuron types in the parasubiculum using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology, and determine their distribution throughout the parasubiculum. We find that the neuronal composition of the parasubiculum differs considerably compared with the neighboring medial entorhinal cortex. Both regions are involved in spatial navigation. Thus, our findings are of importance for unraveling the underlying circuitry of this process and for determining the role of the parasubiculum within this network.},

	abstract = {The medial septum contains cholinergic and GABAergic neurons that project to the hippocampal formation. A significant proportion of the septohippocampal neurons (SHN) exhibit a rhythmically bursting (RB) activity that is involved in the generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The neurochemical nature of septal RB neurons is not firmly established. To address this question, the septal unit activity has been recorded in rats after selective destruction of the cholinergic septal neurons by the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin. Experiments have been performed in urethan-anesthetized and unanesthetized rats, 14-21 days after lesion. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry revealed a near-complete loss of cholinergic septal neurons and of cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus. The recorded neurons were located in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca area. A number of these neurons were identified as projecting to the hippocampus (SHN) by their antidromic response to the electrical stimulation of the fimbria-fornix. In urethan-anesthetized lesioned rats, the percentage of RB neurons decreased significantly as compared with controls (17 vs. 41\% for SHNs and 5 vs. 19\% for unidentified septal neurons). The axonal conduction velocity and the burst frequency of the SHNs that retained a RB activity were higher in lesioned as compared with control rats. The number of spikes per burst was lower and the burst duration was shorter in lesioned rats as compared with controls. The urethan-resistant hippocampal theta was altered both in terms of frequency and amplitude. In unanesthetized lesioned rats, no RB septal neurons were found during arousal, as compared with 25\% in controls. Their number was also markedly reduced during paradoxical sleep (9.7 vs. 38.5\%). Histochemistry in 192 IgG-saporin-treated rats showed that RB neurons were found in areas devoid of AChE-positive neurons but containing parvalbumine-positive (presumably GABAergic) neurons. These data show that RB activity is considerably reduced after selective lesion of the cholinergic medial septal neurons. They suggested that the large majority of the RB septal neurons are cholinergic and that the few neurons that display RB activity in lesioned rats are GABAergic.},

Forty-five percent of these septo-hippocampal neurons (SHNs) discharged rhythmically in short bursts (mean burst frequency, 4 Hz). They were antidromically driven at short latencies from the fimbria. SHNs driven at long latencies (above 5 ms) were never bursting neurons. Fimbria stimulation also had a powerful inhibitory effect on the spontaneous activity of SHNs.The vast majority of the septo-hippocampal neurons were excited by the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or cholinergic agonists, carbachol being the most effective. The acetylcholine-induced excitations were readily abolished by atropine. In contrast hexamethonium and mecamylamine were less effective. The rhythmic bursting activity could not be consistently altered by the iontophoretic application of cholonergic agonists or antagonists or of divalent cations. SHNs were also sensitive to various othe putative neurotransmitters (substance P, GABA) known to play a role in the medial septal area. Bursting neurons and ACh-sensitive neurons were less frequent among unidentified medial septal neurons. The regulation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway is therefore not likely to be due to a direct feedback inhibition by locally released acetylcholine. However a strong inhibitory feedback could be exerted by the hippocampo-septal pathway impinging directly or indirectly on septo-hippocampal neurons.},

Both GABAergic and cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) have been associated with spatial memory, but the relationship between the two neuronal populations is not fully understood. The present study investigated the effect of selective GABAergic MSDB lesions on hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) efflux and spatial memory during tasks that varied in memory demand. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given GABAergic lesions of the MSDB using GAT1-saporin (GAT1-SAP) and examined on spontaneous exploration (Experiment 1) and non-matching to position without (NMTP; Experiment 2) and with a delay (DNMTP; Experiment 3), while concurrently using in vivo microdialysis to measure hippocampal ACh efflux. Intraseptal GAT1-SAP treatment did not alter baseline or behaviorally stimulated hippocampal ACh efflux or maze exploration (Experiment 1). Moreover, GAT1-SAP did not alter evoked hippocampal ACh efflux related to NMTP nor did it impair working memory in NMTP (Experiment 2). In contrast, both ACh efflux and performance in DNMTP were impaired by intraseptal GAT1-SAP. Thus, GABAergic MSDB neurons are important for spatial working memory and modulate hippocampal ACh efflux under conditions of high memory load. The relationship between the septohippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic systems and working memory will be discussed.},

However, knowledge regarding local networks that support in vivo activity is incomplete. Here we identified essential components of LII networks in the MEC. We distinguished four types of excitatory neurons that exhibit cell-type-specific local excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. Furthermore, we found that LII neurons contribute to the excitation of contralateral neurons in the corresponding layer. Finally, we demonstrated that the medial septum controls excitation in the MEC via two subpopulations of long-range GABAergic neurons that target distinct interneurons in LII, thereby disinhibiting local circuits. We thus identified local connections that could support attractor dynamics and external inputs that likely govern excitation in LII.},

The MS-DBB contains cholinergic, GABAergic, and recently described glutamatergic neurons, but their specific contribution to theta generation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm using optogenetic activation and electrophysiological recordings performed in in vitro preparations and in freely behaving mice. The experiments in slices suggest that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons provide prominent excitatory inputs to a majority of local GABAergic and a minority of septal cholinergic neurons. In contrast, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic fiber terminals in hippocampal slices elicited weak postsynaptic responses in hippocampal neurons. In the in vitro septo-hippocampal preparation, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons did increase the rhythmicity of hippocampal theta oscillations, whereas stimulation of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic fibers in the fornix did not have an effect. In freely behaving mice, activation of these neurons in the MS-DBB strongly synchronized hippocampal theta rhythms over a wide range of frequencies, whereas activation of their projections to the hippocampus through fornix stimulations had no effect on theta rhythms, suggesting that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons played a role in theta generation through local modulation of septal neurons. Together, these results provide the first evidence that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons modulate local septal circuits, which in turn contribute to theta rhythms in the hippocampus. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current paper explores the functional role of septal glutamatergic neurons, a recently identified population, in theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus. Using optogenetics and electrophysiology, we have explored the functional connectivity of these neurons in vitro, as well as their influence on theta rhythms both in vitro and in vivo, and show that this neuronal population can powerfully drive theta rhythms through intraseptal connections. These results strongly suggest a role of glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm generation and may therefore be important for learning and memory.},

	abstract = {A detailed analysis of the cortical projections of the medial septum-diagonal band (MS/DB) complex was carried out by means of anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The tracer was injected iontophoretically into cell groups of the medial septum (MS) and the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB and HDB), and sections were processed immunohistochemically for the intra-axonally transported PHA-L. The labeled efferents showed remarkable differences in regional distribution in the cortical mantle dependent on the position of the injection site in the MS/DB complex, revealing a topographic organization of the MS/DB-cortical projection. In brief, the lateral and intermediate aspects of the HDB, also referred to as the magnocellular preoptic area, predominantly project to the olfactory nuclei and the lateral entorhinal cortex. The medial part of the HDB and adjacent caudal (angular) part of the VDB are characterized by widespread, abundant projections to medial mesolimbic, occipital, and lateral entorhinal cortices, olfactory bulb, and dorsal aspects of the subicular and hippocampal areas. Projections from the rostromedial part of the VDB and from the MS are preponderantly aimed at the entire hippocampal and retrohippocampal regions and to a lesser degree at the medial mesolimbic cortex. Furthermore, the MS projections are subject to a clear mediolateral topographic arrangement, such that the lateral MS predominantly projects to the ventral/temporal aspects of the subicular complex and hippocampus and to the medial portion of the entorhinal cortex, whereas more medially located cells in the MS innervate more septal/dorsal parts of the hippocampal and subicular areas and more lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex. PHA-L filled axons have been observed to course through a number of pathways, i. e., the fimbria-fornix system, supracallosal stria, olfactory peduncle, and lateral piriform route (the latter two mainly by the HDB and caudal VDB). Generally, labeled projections were distributed throughout all cortical layers, although clear patterns of lamination were present in several target areas. The richly branching fibers were abundantly provided with both “boutons en passant” and terminal boutons. Both distribution and morphology of the labeled basal forebrain efferents in the prefrontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices closely resemble the distribution and morphology of the cholinergic innervation as revealed by immunohistochemical demonstration of choline acetyltransferase. In contrast, the labeled projections to the olfactory, hippocampal, subicular, and entorhinal areas showed a heterogeneous morphology.

Although cholinergic and GABAergic MS-DBB neurons are known to modulate hippocampal activity, the role of recently described glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons is unknown. Here, we examined the electrophysiological properties of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons and tested whether they provide a functional synaptic input to the hippocampus. To visualize the glutamatergic neurons, we used MS-DBB slices from transgenic mice in which the green fluorescent protein is expressed specifically by vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive neurons and characterized their properties using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. For assessing the function of the glutamatergic projection, we used an in vitro septohippocampal preparation, electrically stimulated the fornix or chemically activated the MS-DBB using NMDA microinfusions and recorded postsynaptic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. We found that glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons as a population display a highly heterogeneous set of firing patterns including fast-, cluster-, burst-, and slow-firing. Remarkably, a significant proportion exhibited fast-firing properties, prominent Ih, and rhythmic spontaneous firing at theta frequencies similar to those found in GABAergic MS-DBB neurons. Activation of the MS-DBB led to fast, AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. These results describe for the first time the electrophysiological signatures of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons, their rhythmic firing properties, and their capacity to drive hippocampal principal neurons. Our findings suggest that the glutamatergic septohippocampal pathway may play an important role in hippocampal theta oscillations and relevant cognitive functions.},

Here, we investigated the physiological role of hippocamposeptal feedback to the MS/DB in a complete in vitro septohippocampal preparation containing the intact interconnecting fornix/fimbria pathway. We demonstrated that carbachol-induced rhythmic theta-like hippocampal oscillations recorded extracellularly were synchronized with powerful rhythmic IPSPs in whole-cell recorded MS/DB neurons. Interestingly, we found that these IPSPs evoked rebound spiking in GABAergic MS/DB neurons. In contrast, putative cholinergic and glutamatergic MS/DB neurons responded only weakly with rebound spiking and, as a result, were mostly silent during theta-like oscillations. We next determined the mechanism underlying the rebound spiking that followed the IPSPs in MS/DB GABAergic neurons using phasic electrical stimulation of the fornix/fimbria pathway. We demonstrate that the increased rebound spiking was attributable to the activation of Ih current, because it was significantly reduced by low concentrations of the Ih antagonist ZD7288 [4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino) pyridinium chloride]. Together, these results suggest that rhythmical activity in hippocampus is transferred to the MS/DB and can preferentially phase the spiking of GABAergic MS/DB neurons because of their significant expression of Ih currents. Our data demonstrate that hippocamposeptal inhibition facilitates theta rhythmic discharges in MS/DB GABAergic neurons while favoring the inhibition of most ACh and glutamate neurons.},

Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in EC. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and II (LI and LII). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in LI and LII of both medial and lateral EC. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT3R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic GABAergic inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease GABA alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral EC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EC activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of LI and LII neurons by the septal cholinergic system.},

In waking guinea pigs, during their inattentive rest, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously in eight brain structures. In the cortical areas (prefrontal and entorhinal fields, hippocampus, dentate gyrus) and subcortical ones (medial and lateral septal nuclei, central nucleus of amygdala, and supramammillary nucleus), different types of oscillations were observed: delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8), alpha (10-12), gamma (40-80), and high-frequency, presumable ripples (100-200Hz). In all structures, low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta) were more powerful than high-frequency ones. Structural communications in different bands of rhythmic activity were expressed differently. On the whole they were the more intensive, the stronger were the oscillations, however, this was not the absolute rule. A long-term (about a month) daily injection of l-glutamate into the medial septal region induced significant changes in theta, gamma, and high-frequency oscillations in most regions examined. The correlations of some structures also changed; they significantly decreased between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in the theta band and between the medial septum and central amygdala in the gamma band. During permanent septal glutamate infusion, distinct signs of epileptogenesis were revealed (epileptiform activity, seizure behavior of animals, and formation of aberrant fibers in the hippocampus). Thus, we believe that the glutamatergic system of medial septum can participate in the development of epilepsy. The earliest sign of pathology in electrical activity was alterations in high-frequency oscillations in the dentate gyrus and medial septum, but the strongest changes were in theta and especially gamma rhythms in many structures. The data obtained help to advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of brain functioning and its disturbances in seizure pathology.},

Speed is encoded by speed-responsive cells in both MEC and hippocampus, but the relationship between the two populations has not been determined.

The data point to PV-expressing GABAergic projection neurons in MEC as a source for widespread speed modulation and temporal synchronization in entorhinal–hippocampal circuits for place representation.},

	abstract = {The medial septum-diagonal band (MSDB) complex is considered as a pacemaker for the hippocampal theta rhythm. Identification of the different cell types, their electro-physiological properties and their possible function in the generation of a synchronized activity in the MSDB is a hot topic. A recent electro-physiological study showed the presence of two antiphasically firing populations of parvalbumin containing GABAergic neurons in the MSDB. Other papers described a network of cluster-firing glutamatergic neurons, which is able to generate synchronized activity in the MSDB. We propose two different computer models for the generation of synchronized population theta oscillation in the MSDB and compare their properties. In the first model GABAergic neurons are intrinsically theta periodic cluster-firing cells; while in the second model GABAergic cells are fast-firing cells and receive periodic input from local glutamatergic neurons simulated as cluster-firing cells. Using computer simulations we show that the GABAergic neurons in both models are capable of generating antiphasic theta periodic population oscillation relying on local, septal mechanisms. In the first model antiphasic theta synchrony could emerge if GABAergic neurons form two populations preferentially innervate each other. In the second model in-phase synchronization of glutamatergic neurons does not require specific network structure, and the network of these cells are able to act as a theta pacemaker for the local fast-firing GABAergic circuit. Our simulations also suggest that neurons being non-cluster-firing in vitro might exhibit clustering properties when connected into a network in vivo.},

Targets of the supramammillary afferents in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex were identified by combining anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin with immunostaining for putative postsynaptic neurons, i.e. for parvalbumin and choline acetyltransferase that are known to label the GABAergic and cholinergic neurons, respectively, of the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. Double retrograde transport experiments using the tracers horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated colloidal gold were employed to identify supramammillary neurons that project both to the hippocampus and the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into the supramammillary nucleus of the rat resulted in dense fibre and terminal labelling in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. Labelled terminals formed asymmetric synapses mainly on distal dendrites of medial septal neurons. Proximal dendrites and somata were rarely contacted. The supramammillary afferents showed no target selectivity for a particular cell type; they innervated both cholinergic and GABAergic cells. Occasionally, perisomatic, basket-like terminals of supramammillary origin were found around parvalbumin-containing neurons. Double-retrograde experiments revealed that at least 25\% of the supramammillo-hippocampal cells also projected to the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca.These data suggest that the nucleus, known to modulate the hippocampal electrical activity directly by the supramammillo-hippocampal pathway, also has the potential for an indirect action via the innervation of both the GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons. This dual modulation may originate, at least in part, from the same population of supramammillary neurons.},

GABAergic neurons exhibiting highly regular firing coupled to the hippocampal theta rhythm are thought to form the core of the MS rhythm-generating network. In recent studies the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated non-selective cation (HCN) channel was shown to participate in theta synchronization of the medial septum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HCN channel expression correlates with theta modulated firing behaviour of MS neurons by a combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach. HCN-expressing neurons represented a subpopulation of GABAergic cells in the MS partly overlapping with parvalbumin (PV)-containing neurons. Rhythmic firing in the theta frequency range was characteristic of all HCN-expressing neurons. In contrast, only a minority of HCN-negative cells displayed theta related activity. All HCN cells had tight phase coupling to hippocampal theta waves. As a group, PV-expressing HCN neurons had a marked bimodal phase distribution, whereas PV-immunonegative HCN neurons did not show group-level phase preference despite significant individual phase coupling. Microiontophoretic blockade of HCN channels resulted in the reduction of discharge frequency, but theta rhythmic firing was perturbed only in a few cases. Our data imply that HCN-expressing GABAergic neurons provide rhythmic drive in all phases of the hippocampal theta activity. In most MS theta cells rhythm genesis is apparently determined by interactions at the level of the network rather than by the pacemaking property of HCN channels alone.},

Spike timing of basket cells tuned the phase and amplitude of gamma oscillations generated around stratum pyramidale, where basket cells selectively innervate pyramidal cells with GABAergic synapses. Basket cells did not contribute to gamma oscillations generated at the apical tuft of pyramidal cells. This gamma oscillation was selectively modulated by a subset of local GABAergic interneurons and by medial entorhinal cortex layer 3 neurons.

Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that GABAergic medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178°) or the peak (330°) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.},

	abstract = {Temporal coordination of neuronal assemblies among cortical areas is essential for behavioral performance. GABAergic projections from the medial septum and diagonal band complex exclusively innervate GABAergic interneurons in the rat hippocampus, contributing to the coordination of neuronal activity, including the generation of theta oscillations. Much less is known about the synaptic target neurons outside the hippocampus. To reveal the contribution of synaptic circuits involving the medial septum of mice, we have identified postsynaptic cortical neurons in wild-type and parvalbumin-Cre knock-in mice. Anterograde axonal tracing from the septum revealed extensive innervation of the hippocampus as well as the subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, and the retrosplenial cortex. In all examined cortical regions, many septal GABAergic boutons were in close apposition to somata or dendrites immunopositive for interneuron cell-type molecular markers, such as parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 1, cholecystokinin, reelin, or a combination of these molecules. Electron microscopic observations revealed septal boutons forming axosomatic or axodendritic type II synapses. In the CA1 region of hippocampus, septal GABAergic projections exclusively targeted interneurons. In the retrosplenial cortex, 93\% of identified postsynaptic targets belonged to interneurons and the rest to pyramidal cells. These results suggest that the GABAergic innervation from the medial septum and diagonal band complex contributes to temporal coordination of neuronal activity via several types of cortical GABAergic interneurons in both hippocampal and extrahippocampal cortices. Oscillatory septal neuronal firing at delta, theta, and gamma frequencies may phase interneuron activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Diverse types of GABAergic interneurons coordinate the firing of cortical principal cells required for memory processes. During wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep, the rhythmic firing of cortical GABAergic neurons plays a key role in governing network activity. We investigated subcortical GABAergic projections in the mouse that extend from the medial septum/diagonal band nuclei to GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and related extrahippocampal cortical areas, including the medial entorhinal cortex. These areas contribute to navigation and show theta rhythmic activity. We found selective GABAergic targeting of different groups of cortical GABAergic neurons, immunoreactive for combinations of cell-type markers. As septal GABAergic neurons also fire rhythmically, their selective innervation of cortical GABAergic neurons suggests an oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity across functionally related areas.},

More recently, indirect ways to regulate NMDA that would be less disruptive have been proposed and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) represents one such candidate. To characterize the cell populations involved, we demonstrated here that knock-out (KO) of mGluR5 in cholinergic, but not glutamatergic or parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic, neurons reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and enhanced sensitivity to MK801-induced locomotor activity. Inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) resulted in reduced PPI further demonstrating the importance of these neurons in sensorimotor gating. Volume imaging and quantification were used to compare PV and cholinergic cell distribution, density, and total cell counts in the different cell-type-specific KO lines. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced NMDA receptor-mediated currents in cholinergic neurons of the medial septum in mGluR5 KO mice. These results obtained from male and female mice indicate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell type involved in sensorimotor gating and are relevant to pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating such as schizophrenia.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mechanistic complexity underlying psychiatric disorders remains a major challenge that is hindering the drug discovery process. Here, we generated genetically modified mouse lines to better characterize the involvement of the receptor mGluR5 in the fine-tuning of NMDA receptors, specifically in the context of sensorimotor gating. We evaluated the importance of knocking-out mGluR5 in three different cell types in two brain regions and performed different sets of experiments including behavioral testing and electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrated that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell-type involved in sensorimotor gating.

Interareal projections are mainly mediated by glutamatergic pyramidal cell projections; only few long-range GABAergic connections have been reported. Using in vivo recording and labeling of single cells and retrograde axonal tracing, we demonstrate novel long-range GABAergic projection neurons in the rat hippocampus: (1) somatostatin- and predominantly mGluR1α-positive neurons in stratum oriens project to the subiculum, other cortical areas, and the medial septum; (2) neurons in stratum oriens, including somatostatin-negative ones; and (3) trilaminar cells project to the subiculum and/or other cortical areas but not the septum. These three populations strongly increase their firing during sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, communicating this network state to the septotemporal system. Finally, a large population of somatostatin-negative GABAergic cells in stratum radiatum project to the molecular layers of the subiculum, presubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and indusium griseum and fire rhythmically at high rates during theta oscillations but do not increase their firing during ripples. The GABAergic projection axons have a larger diameter and thicker myelin sheet than those of CA1 pyramidal cells. Therefore, rhythmic IPSCs are likely to precede the arrival of excitation in cortical areas (e.g., subiculum) that receive both glutamatergic and GABAergic projections from the CA1 area. Other areas, including the retrosplenial cortex, receive only rhythmic GABAergic CA1 input. We conclude that direct GABAergic projections from the hippocampus to other cortical areas and the septum contribute to coordinating oscillatory timing across structures.},

	abstract = {The medial septum implements cortical theta oscillations, a 5-12 Hz rhythm associated with locomotion and paradoxical sleep, reflecting synchronization of neuronal assemblies e.g. place cell sequence coding. Highly rhythmic burst-firing parvalbumin-positive GABAergic medial septal neurons are strongly coupled to theta oscillations and target cortical GABAergic interneurons, contributing to coordination within one or several cortical regions. However, a large population of medial septal neurons of unidentified neurotransmitter phenotype and with unknown axonal target areas fire with a low degree of rhythmicity. We investigated whether low-rhythmic firing neurons (LRNs) innervated similar or different cortical regions to high-rhythmic neurons (HRNs) and assessed their temporal dynamics in awake male mice. The majority of LRNs were GABAergic and parvalbumin-immunonegative, some expressing calbindin; they innervated interneurons mostly in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. Individual LRNs showed several distinct firing patterns during immobility and locomotion, forming a parallel inhibitory stream for the modulation of cortical interneurons. Despite their fluctuating firing rates, the preferred firing phase of LRNs during theta oscillations matched the highest firing probability phase of principal cells in the DG and CA3. In addition, as a population, LRNs were markedly suppressed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, had a low burst incidence, and several of them did not fire on all theta cycles. Thus, CA3 receives GABAergic input from both HRNs and LRNs, but the DG receives mainly LRN input. We propose that distinct GABAergic LRNs contribute to changing the excitability of the DG and CA3 during memory discrimination via transient disinhibition of principal cells.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFor the encoding and recall of episodic memories, nerve cells in the cerebral cortex are activated in precisely timed sequences. Rhythmicity facilitates the coordination of neuronal activity, and these rhythms are detected as oscillations of different frequencies, such as 5-12 Hz theta oscillations. Degradation of these rhythms, e.g. through neurodegeneration, causes memory deficits. The medial septum, a part of the basal forebrain that innervates the hippocampal formation, contains high-rhythmic and low-rhythmic firing neurons, which may contribute differentially to cortical neuronal coordination. We discovered that GABAergic low-rhythmic neurons preferentially innervate the dentate gyrus and the CA3 area of the hippocampus, regions important for episodic memory. These neurons act in parallel with the high-rhythmic neurons, mostly via transient inhibition of inhibitory neurons.},

In the hippocampus, GABAergic neurons project to the medial septum and retrohippocampal areas. Many GABAergic projection cells express somatostatin (SOM+) and, together with locally terminating SOM+ bistratified and O-LM cells, contribute to dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. We tested the hypothesis that diversity in SOM+ cells reflects temporal specialization during behavior using extracellular single cell recording and juxtacellular neurobiotin-labeling in freely moving rats. We have demonstrated that rare GABAergic projection neurons discharge rhythmically and are remarkably diverse. During sharp wave-ripples, most projection cells, including a novel SOM+ GABAergic back-projecting cell, increased their activity similar to bistratified cells, but unlike O-LM cells. During movement, most projection cells discharged along the descending slope of theta cycles, but some fired at the trough jointly with bistratified and O-LM cells. The specialization of hippocampal SOM+ projection neurons complements the action of local interneurons in differentially phasing inputs from the CA3 area to CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites during sleep and wakefulness. Our observations suggest that GABAergic projection cells mediate the behavior- and network state-dependent binding of neuronal assemblies amongst functionally-related brain regions by transmitting local rhythmic entrainment of neurons in CA1 to neuronal populations in other areas.

We recorded septo-hippocampal GABAergic cells that were activated during hippocampal sharp waves and projected to CA3.

Efferents of the CA1-projecting subiculum neurons also target the perirhinal cortex, an area strongly implicated in object–place learning. We identify a critical role for CA1-projecting subicular neurons in object-location learning and memory, and show that this projection modulates place-specific activity of CA1 neurons and their responses to displaced objects. Together, these experiments reveal a novel pathway by which cortical inputs, particularly those from the visual cortex, reach the hippocampal output region CA1. Our findings also implicate this circuitry in the formation of complex spatial representations and learning of object–place associations.

The anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin-L and biotinylated dextran amine were injected into the subiculum at different septotemporal and transverse levels. Deep layers of the ento-, peri-, and postrhinal cortices are the main recipients of subicular projections, but in all cases we noted that a small fraction of the projections also terminates in the superficial layers II and III. Analysis of the fiber patterns in the parahippocampal region revealed a topographic organization, depending on the location of the cells of origin along both the transverse and the septotemporal axes of the subiculum. Projections originating from subicular cells close to CA1, i.e., proximal part of subiculum, terminate exclusively in the lateral entorhinal cortex and in the perirhinal cortex. In contrast, projections from cells closer to the subiculum-presubiculum border, i.e., distal part of subiculum, terminate in the medial entorhinal cortex and in the postrhinal cortex. In addition, cells in septal portions of the subiculum project to a lateral band of entorhinal cortex parallel to the rhinal sulcus and to peri- or postrhinal cortices, whereas cells in more temporal portions project to more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex. These results indicate that subicular projections to the parahippocampal region precisely reciprocate the known inputs from this region to the hippocampal formation. We thus suggest that the reciprocal connectivity between the subiculum and the parahippocampal region is organized as parallel pathways that serve to segregate information flow and thus maintain the identity of processed information. Although this parallel organization is comparable to that of the CA1-parahippocampal projections, differences exist with respect to the degree of collateralization. J. Comp.

Because the parasubiculum (PaS) has extensive connections, either directly or indirectly, with these structures, it is centrally located to influence the neuronal activity in these areas. This study was therefore designed to determine the types of behavioral and spatial correlates in neurons from the PaS. Single unit recordings were conducted in the PaS of freely moving rats trained to retrieve food pellets thrown randomly into a cylindrical apparatus. A total of 10.3\% of the cells were classified as place cells because they discharged in relation to the animal's location in the cylinder. A large percentage of cells (41.4\%) were classified as theta cells. The remaining cells had nondiscernable behavioral correlates. Quantitative analysis of the firing rate maps for the place cells showed they had higher levels of background activity and contained larger firing fields than values reported previously for hippocampal place cells. Directional analysis showed that only three out of 16 cells contained a secondary directional correlate; the firing rate for the remaining cells was not affected by the animal's directional heading within the firing field. A time shift analysis, which shifted the spike time series relative to the animal location series, was conducted to determine whether the quality of the location-specific firing could be improved. The time shifts for three different spatial parameters were optimal when cell discharge led the animal's position. Furthermore, the optimal time shifts for two of these parameters (firing area and information content) were less than the optimal shift reported for hippocampal place cells and suggested that PaS cell discharge lagged behind hippocampal place cell activity. Rotation of the cue card with the animal out of view led to near equal rotation of the firing field when the animal was returned to the apparatus. These results indicate that a small population of cells in the PaS encode the animal's location in its environment, although the representation of space encoded by these cells is different from the type of representation encoded by hippocampal place cells. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of optogenetic stimulation for altering hippocampal oscillations in freely moving wild-type rats, or how these alterations would affect performance on behavioral tasks. Here, we used an AAV virus to express ChR2 in the medial septum (MS) of wild-type rats, and optically stimulated septal neurons at 6 Hz and 30 Hz. We measured the corresponding effects of these stimulations on the oscillations of the MS and hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 in three different contexts: (1) With minimal movement while the rats sat in a confined chamber; (2) Explored a novel open field; and (3) Learned and performed a T-maze behavioral task. While control yellow light stimulation did not affect oscillations, 6-Hz blue light septal stimulations altered hippocampal theta oscillations in a manner that depended on the animal's mobility and speed. While the 30 Hz blue light septal stimulations only altered theta frequency in CA1 while the rat had limited mobility, it robustly increased the amplitude of hippocampal signals at 30 Hz in both regions in all three recording contexts. We found that animals were more likely to make a correct choice during Day 1 of T-maze training during both MS stimulation protocols than during control stimulation, and that improved performance was independent of theta frequency alterations.},

The question of primary concern in the present research was whether the group of anatomically related structures (hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum/parasubiculum, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal/postrhinal cortex) are involved in mediating a similar memory process or whether the individual structures are differentially involved in memory processes and/or in handling various types of information. A series of five experiments were carried out that involved selectively lesioning the main MTL structures and testing each animal on radial-maze tasks and procedures that provided measures of two different memory processes (reference memory, working memory) and the utilization of two kinds of information (spatial, nonspatial). The structures were found to differ functionally, with the hippocampus and the presubiculum/parasubiculum being especially involved in processing spatial information, and the perirhinal/postrhinal cortex having a specific role in remembering information over a brief time period (working memory). Lesions of the entorhinal cortex failed to affect consistently either memory process or type of information handled, but they did result in impairments in learning the complex spatial discrimination requiring reference memory and in working memory involving nonspatial information. The pattern of behavioral impairments resulting from damage to these discrete MTL structures suggests that several of the structures make unique contributions to learning and memory. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Estimates of neuron numbers have been useful in studies of neurodegenerative disorders, and in their animal models, and in the computational modeling of hippocampal function. Although the retrohippocampal region (presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area) is an integral part of the hippocampal circuitry and is affected selectively in a number of disorders, estimates of neuron numbers in the rat retrohippocampal region have yet to be published. Such data are necessary ingredients for computational models of the function of this region and will also facilitate a comparison of this region in rats and primates, which will help to determine how well we may expect rat models to predict function and dysfunction in primate brains. In the present study, we used the optical fractionator to estimate the number of neurons in the rat retrohippocampal region. The following estimates were obtained: 3.3 × 105 in presubicular layers II and III, 1.5 × 105 in parasubicular layers II and III, 2.2 × 105 in the combined pre- and parasubicular layers V and VI, 6.6 × 104 in medial entorhinal area (MEA) layer II, 1.3 × 105 in MEA layer III, 1.9 × 105 in MEA layers V and VI, 4.6 × 104 in lateral entorhinal area (LEA) layer II, 1.2 × 105 in LEA layer III, and 1.4 × 105 in LEA layers V and VI. A surprising finding was the large numbers of neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum, which indicate an important role of these areas in the control of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. A comparison of the numbers of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal areas in rats with similar estimates in humans revealed that gross input-output relations are largely conserved. Differences between rats and humans may be accounted for by more prominent entorhino-neocortical projections in primates and consequent increases in the number of neurons in the hippocampus and retrohippocampal region, which are dedicated to these projections.

Repeated arms were presented with lags ranging from zero to six (from zero to six different arm presentations occurred between the first and repeated presentation). After completion of acquisition training (significantly longer latencies for repeated arms in comparison with the first presentation of an arm), rats received lesions of the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, pre- and parasubiculum, or served as sham-operated controls. Based on continued postsurgery training and additional tests, the results indicated that rats with pre- and parasubiculum or pre- and parasubiculum plus medial entorhinal cortex produced sustained impairment in performing the task. Medial or lateral entorhinal cortex and control lesions did not display any sustained deficits. The data suggest that working memory for spatial location information is mediated primarily by the pre- and parasubiculum, but not medial entorhinal and lateral entorhinal cortex.

	abstract = {We provide a concise review of recent studies related to the development of neural circuits supporting spatial navigation and memory in the rat. We chart the relative timeline of the emergence of the four main classes of spatially tuned neurons within the hippocampus and related limbic areas: head direction cells emerge earliest (postnatal day 12, P12), before the eyes of the rats are even open, followed by place cells and boundary responsive cells; grid cells emerge last, around the age of weaning (P21). The rate of maturation is unique to each type of neuron, with the head direction and grid cells showing rapid developmental spurts, in contrast to place cells, which show a more gradual trend of maturation. Interestingly, the emergence of allocentric spatial abilities occurs only after the full complement of spatial neurons becomes functional at P20–21, whereas associative processing in the place cell network is evident from as early as P16. We also present evidence supporting the view that the sensory inputs, which are particularly salient to adult spatial networks, may not be essential for the immature spatial system. Crucially, visual information, although more salient than other sensory modalities for anchoring the adult head direction system, does not appear to be essential for setting up the immature head direction network. We conclude by highlighting an urgent need for new theoretical models that can account for the sequential emergence of spatial cells, as well as the lack of primacy of vision in the early organization of the head direction network.

	abstract = {Principal neurons in different medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) layers show variations in spatial modulation that stabilize between 15 and 30 days postnatally. These in vivo variations are likely due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties and integrative capacities of neurons. The latter depends on inputs and thus potentially on the morphology of principal neurons. In this comprehensive study, we systematically compared the morphological and physiological characteristics of principal neurons in all MEC layers of newborn rats before and after weaning. We recorded simultaneously from up to four post-hoc morphologically identified MEC principal neurons in vitro. Neurons in L(ayer) I-LIII have dendritic and axonal arbors mainly in superficial layers, and LVI neurons mainly in deep layers. The dendritic and axonal trees of part of LV neurons diverge throughout all layers. Physiological properties of principal neurons differ between layers. In LII, most neurons have a prominent sag potential, resonance and membrane oscillations. Neurons in LIII and LVI fire relatively regular, and lack sag potentials and membrane oscillations. LV neurons show the most prominent spike-frequency adaptation and highest input resistance. The data indicate that adult-like principal neuron types can be differentiated early on during postnatal development. The results of the accompanying paper, in which principal neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) were described (Canto and Witter,2011), revealed that significant differences between LEC and MEC exist mainly in LII neurons. We therefore systematically analyzed changes in LII biophysical properties along the mediolateral axis of MEC and LEC. There is a gradient in properties typical for MEC LII neurons. These properties are most pronounced in medially located neurons and become less apparent in more laterally positioned ones. This gradient continues into LEC, such that in LEC medially positioned neurons share some properties with adjacent MEC cells. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contain spatially selective neurons that are crucial for spatial navigation and memory. These highly specialized neurons include grid cells, border cells, head-direction cells, and irregular spatially selective cells. In addition, MEC neurons display a large variability in their spike patterns at a millisecond time scale. In this study, we analyzed spike trains of neurons in the MEC superficial layers of mice and found that these neurons can be classified into two groups based on their propensity to fire spike doublets at 125–250 Hz. The two groups, labeled “bursty” and “non-bursty” neurons, differed in their spike waveforms and interspike interval adaptation but displayed a similar mean firing rate. Grid cell spatial periodicity was more commonly observed in bursty than in non-bursty neurons. In contrast, most neurons with head-direction selectivity or those that fired at the border of the environment were non-bursty neurons. During theta oscillations, both bursty and non-bursty neurons fired preferentially near the end of the descending phase of the cycle, but the spikes of bursty neurons occurred at an earlier phase than those of non-bursty neurons. Finally, analysis of spike-time crosscorrelations between simultaneously recorded neurons suggested that the two cell classes are differentially coupled to fast-spiking interneurons: bursty neurons were twice as likely to have excitatory interactions with putative interneurons as non-bursty neurons. These results demonstrate that bursty and non-bursty neurons are differentially integrated in the MEC network and preferentially encode distinct spatial signals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We report that neurons in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex can be classified based on their tendency to fire bursts of action potentials at 125–250 Hz. The relevance of this classification is demonstrated by the types of spatial information preferentially encoded by bursty and non-bursty neurons. Grid-like spatial periodicity is more commonly observed in bursty neurons, whereas most cells with head-direction selectivity or those that are firing at the border of the environment are non-bursty neurons. This work indicates that the spatial firing patterns of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex can be predicted by electrophysiological features reflecting the synaptic inputs and/or integrating properties of the neurons.},

Impairment in recognition memory is a prominent feature of amnesia and a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons contain two major groups, one localized in the medial septum (MS)/vertical diagonal band of Broca (vDB) and the other in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). The roles of these cell groups in recognition memory have been debated and it remains unclear how they contribute to it. We use a genetic cell targeting technique to selectively eliminate cholinergic cell groups and then test spatial and object recognition memory through different behavioural tasks. Eliminating MS/vDB neurons impairs spatial but not object recognition memory in the reference and working memory tasks, whereas NBM elimination undermines only object recognition memory in the working memory task. These impairments are restored by treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, anti-dementia drugs for AD. Our results highlight that MS/vDB and NBM cholinergic neurons are not only implicated in recognition memory but also have essential roles in different types of recognition memory.},

Here, we examined the effects of the α1-AR agonist phenylephrine (Phe) on GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of the mPFC. We found that bath application of Phe dose-dependently increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). Phe increased the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Ca2+ influx through T-type voltage-gated calcium channels is required for Phe-induced increases in GABA release. Phe increases GABA release probability and the number of releasable vesicles. Phe depolarizes the fast-spiking (FS) interneurons without effects on the firing rate of action potentials (APs) of interneurons. Phe-induced depolarization is independent of extracellular Na+, Ca2+ and T-type calcium channels, but requires inward rectifier K+ channels (Kirs). The present study demonstrates that Phe enhances GABAergic transmission onto mPFC pyramidal neurons through inhibiting interneurons Kirs, which further depolarizes interneurons leading to increase in Ca2+ influx via T-type calcium channels. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that helps explain α1-AR-induced PFC dysfunction.},

We used transgenically targeted viral tracing to identify the monosynaptic inputs to the projection neurons of layer II of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC-LII) in mice. These neurons are not only major inputs to the hippocampus, the structure most clearly implicated in learning and memory, they also are “grid cells.” Here we address the question of what kinds of inputs are specifically targeting these MEC-LII cells. Cell-specific infection of MEC-LII with recombinant rabies virus results in unambiguous labeling of monosynaptic inputs. Furthermore, ratios of labeled neurons in different regions are largely consistent between animals, suggesting that label reflects density of innervation. While the results mostly confirm prior anatomical work, they also reveal a novel major direct input to MEC-LII from hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, the vast majority of these direct hippocampal inputs arise not from the major hippocampal subfields of CA1 and CA3, but from area CA2, a region that has historically been thought to merely be a transitional zone between CA3 and CA1. We confirmed this unexpected result using conventional tracing techniques in both rats and mice.},

However, the neural site of convergence for representations of landmarks and representations of space has yet to be identified. A potential site of plasticity underlying associations with landmarks is the postsubiculum. To test this, we blocked glutamatergic transmission in the rat postsubiculum with CNQX, or NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity with d-AP5. These infusions were sufficient to block evoked potentials from the lateral dorsal thalamus and long-term depression following tetanization of this input to the postsubiculum, respectively. In a second experiment, CNQX disrupted the stability of rat hippocampal place cell fields in a familiar environment. In a novel environment, blockade of plasticity with d-AP5 in the postsubiculum did not block the formation of a stable place field map following a 6 h delay. In a final behavioral experiment, postsubicular infusions of both compounds blocked object-location memory in the rat, but did not affect object recognition memory. These results suggest that the postsubiculum is necessary for the recognition of familiar environments, and that NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the postsubiculum is required for the formation of new object–place associations that support recognition memory. However, plasticity in the postsubiculum is not necessary for the formation of new spatial maps.},

	abstract = {In hippocampal area CA1 of rats, the frequency of gamma activity has been shown to increase with running speed (Ahmed and Mehta, 2012). This finding suggests that different gamma frequencies simply allow for different timings of transitions across cell assemblies at varying running speeds, rather than serving unique functions. However, accumulating evidence supports the conclusion that slow (∼25–55 Hz) and fast (∼60–100 Hz) gamma are distinct network states with different functions. If slow and fast gamma constitute distinct network states, then it is possible that slow and fast gamma frequencies are differentially affected by running speed. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that slow and fast gamma frequencies change differently as a function of running speed in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Fast gamma frequencies increased with increasing running speed in all three areas. Slow gamma frequencies changed significantly less across different speeds. Furthermore, at high running speeds, CA3 firing rates were low, and MEC firing rates were high, suggesting that CA1 transitions from CA3 inputs to MEC inputs as running speed increases. These results support the hypothesis that slow and fast gamma reflect functionally distinct states in the hippocampal network, with fast gamma driven by MEC at high running speeds and slow gamma driven by CA3 at low running speeds. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {To understand the structural basis of grid cell activity, we compare medial entorhinal cortex architecture in layer 2 across five mammalian species (Etruscan shrews, mice, rats, Egyptian fruit bats, and humans), bridging ∼100 million years of evolutionary diversity. Principal neurons in layer 2 are divided into two distinct cell types, pyramidal and stellate, based on morphology, immunoreactivity, and functional properties. We confirm the existence of patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal cells across these species, arranged periodically according to analyses techniques like spatial autocorrelation, grid scores, and modifiable areal unit analysis. In rodents, which show sustained theta oscillations in entorhinal cortex, cholinergic innervation targeted calbindin patches. In bats and humans, which only show intermittent entorhinal theta activity, cholinergic innervation avoided calbindin patches. The organization of calbindin-negative and calbindin-positive cells showed marked differences in entorhinal subregions of the human brain. Layer 2 of the rodent medial and the human caudal entorhinal cortex were structurally similar in that in both species patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal cells were superimposed on scattered stellate cells. The number of calbindin-positive neurons in a patch increased from ∼80 in Etruscan shrews to ∼800 in humans, only an ∼10-fold over a 20,000-fold difference in brain size. The relatively constant size of calbindin patches differs from cortical modules such as barrels, which scale with brain size. Thus, selective pressure appears to conserve the distribution of stellate and pyramidal cells, periodic arrangement of calbindin patches, and relatively constant neuron number in calbindin patches in medial/caudal entorhinal cortex.

However, it remains unclear what determines AP initiation in different interneurons. We focused on two predominant interneuron types in neocortex: parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons. Patch-clamp recording from mouse prefrontal cortical slices showed that axonal but not somatic Na+ channels exhibit different voltage-dependent properties. The minimal activation voltage of axonal channels in SST was substantially higher (∼7 mV) than in PV cells, consistent with differences in AP thresholds. A more mixed distribution of high- and low-threshold channel subtypes at the axon initial segment (AIS) of SST cells may lead to these differences. Surprisingly, NaV1.2 was found accumulated at AIS of SST but not PV cells; reducing NaV1.2-mediated currents in interneurons promoted recurrent network activity. Together, our results reveal the molecular identity of axonal Na+ channels in interneurons and their contribution to AP generation and regulation of network activity.},

We investigated interregional coordination of gamma oscillations using high-density electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We found that 30–80 Hz gamma dominated CA1 local field potentials (LFPs) on the descending phase of CA1 theta waves during navigation, with 60–120 Hz gamma at the theta peak. These signals corresponded to CA3 and entorhinal input, respectively. Above 50 Hz, interregional phase-synchronization of principal cell spikes occurred mostly for LFPs in the axonal target domain. CA1 pyramidal cells were phase-locked mainly to fast gamma ({\textgreater}100 Hz) LFP patterns restricted to CA1, which were strongest at the theta trough. While theta phase coordination of spiking across entorhinal-hippocampal regions depended on memory demands, LFP gamma patterns below 100 Hz in the hippocampus were consistently layer specific and largely reflected afferent activity. Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies.},

Moreover, the authors find that layer 3 of the entorhinal cortex does not project to CA2. The formation and recall of episodic memory requires precise information processing by the entorhinal-hippocampal network. For several decades, the trisynaptic circuit entorhinal cortex layer II (ECII)→dentate gyrus→CA3→CA1 and the monosynaptic circuit ECIII→CA1 have been considered the primary substrates of the network responsible for learning and memory. Circuits linked to another hippocampal region, CA2, have only recently come to light. Using highly cell type–specific transgenic mouse lines, optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings, we found that dentate gyrus cells, long believed to not project to CA2, send functional monosynaptic inputs to CA2 pyramidal cells through abundant longitudinal projections. CA2 innervated CA1 to complete an alternate trisynaptic circuit, but, unlike CA3, projected preferentially to the deep, rather than to the superficial, sublayer of CA1. Furthermore, contrary to existing knowledge, ECIII did not project to CA2. Our results allow a deeper understanding of the biology of learning and memory.},

This syndrome has been attributed to mutations in the WFS1 gene. In this study, we made a detailed histochemical analysis of the distribution of Wfs1 mRNA in the brain of developing mice. There were three patterns of change in the strength of Wfs1 mRNA signals from birth to early adulthood. In type 1, the signals were weak or absent in neonates but strong or moderate in young adults. This pattern was observed in the CA1 field, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. In type 2, the signals were of a relatively constant strength during development. This pattern was seen in limbic structures (e.g. subiculum and central amygdaloid nucleus) and brainstem nuclei (e.g. facial and chochlear nuclei). In type 3, the signals peaked in the second week of age. This pattern was observed in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Thus, Wfs1 mRNA was widely distributed in the normal mouse brain during postnatal development. This evidence may provide clues as to the physiological role of the Wfs1 gene in the central nervous system, and help to explain endocrinological, otological, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms in Wolfram syndrome patients.},

Loss of Wfs1 function results in Wolfram syndrome (OMIM 222300) characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and psychiatric disorders. Similarly, Wfs1−/− mice exhibit diabetes and increased basal anxiety. In the adult central nervous system Wfs1 is prominent in central extended amygdala, striatum and hippocampus, brain structures largely involved in behavioral adaptation of the organism. Here, we describe the initiation pattern of Wfs1 expression in mouse forebrain using mRNA in situ hybridization and compare it with Synaptophysin (Syp1), a gene encoding synaptic vesicle protein widely used as neuronal differentiation marker. We show that the expression of Wfs1 starts during late embryonic development in the dorsal striatum and amygdala, then expands broadly at birth, possessing several transitory regions during maturation. Syp1 expression precedes Wfs1 and it is remarkably upregulated during the period of Wfs1 expression initiation and maturation, suggesting relationship between neural activation and Wfs1 expression. Using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR we show that UPR-related genes (Grp78, Grp94, and Chop) display dynamic expression in the perinatal brain when Wfs1 is initiated and their expression pattern is not altered in the brain lacking functional Wfs1.},

We show that ribosomes can be tagged with a camelid nanobody raised against GFP and that this system can be engineered to selectively capture translating mRNAs from neurons retrogradely labeled with GFP. Using this system, we profiled neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. We then used an AAV to selectively profile midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. By comparing the captured mRNAs from each experiment, we identified a number of markers specific to VTA dopaminergic projection neurons.

Little is known concerning the function of the WFS1 protein (wolframin). Endoglycosidase H digestion, immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation studies all indicated that wolframin is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in rat brain hippocampus and rat pancreatic islet β-cells, and after ectopic expression in Xenopus oocytes. Reconstitution of wolframin from oocyte membranes into planar lipid bilayers demonstrated that the protein induced a large cation-selective ion channel that was blocked by Mg2+ or Ca2+. Inositol triphosphate was capable of activating channels in the fused bilayers that were similar to channel components induced by wolframin expression. Expression of wolframin also increased cytosolic calcium levels in oocytes. Wolframin thus appears to be important in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Disruption of this function may place cells at risk to suffer inappropriate death decisions, thus accounting for the progressive β-cell loss and neuronal degeneration associated with the disease.},

	abstract = {Wolfram (DIDMOAD) syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. Recent positional cloning led to identification of the WFS1 (Wolfram syndrome 1) gene, a member of a novel gene family of unknown function. In this study, we generated a specific antibody against the C-terminus of the WFS1 protein and investigated its subcellular localization in cultured cells. We also studied its distribution in the rat brain. Biochemical studies indicated the WFS1 protein to be an integral, endoglycosidase H-sensitive membrane glycoprotein that localizes primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence cell staining of overexpressed WFS1 showed a characteristic reticular pattern over the cytoplasm and overlapped with the ER marker staining. No co-localization of WFS1 with mitochondria argues against an earlier clinical hypothesis that Wolfram syndrome is a mitochondria-mediated disorder. In the rat brain, at both the protein and mRNA level, WFS1 was found to be present predominantly in selected neurons in the hippocampus CA1, amygdaloid areas, olfactory tubercle and superficial layer of the allocortex. These expression sites, i.e. components of the limbic system or structures closely associated with this system, may be involved in the psychiatric, behavioral and emotional abnormalities characteristic of this syndrome. ER localization of WFS1 suggests that this protein plays an as yet undefined role in membrane trafficking, protein processing and/or regulation of ER calcium homeostasis. These studies represent a first step toward the characterization of WFS1 protein, which presumably functions to maintain certain populations of neuronal and endocrine cells.},

	abstract = {The presubiculum and parasubiculum are retrohippocampal structures bordered by the subiculum and medial entorhinal cortex. Deep layer (IV-VI) neurons from this region exhibit stable synaptically triggered burst behaviour which distinguishes them from superficial layer (I-III) cells. This functional separation was examined with intracellular and field potential recordings from horizontal slices of rat brain. Neurobiotin labelling and rapid Golgi techniques were used to obtain anatomical evidence of axonal trajectories. 2Extracellular stimulation of the subiculum, deep medial entorhinal cortex or superficial pre-or parasubiculum caused, in deep layer cells only, a short latency burst discharge which could be followed by one or more after-discharges. Bursts appeared after repetitive stimulation and were stable for the life of the slice. Each event was supported by giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Events were similar whether they were evoked in horizontal slices or slices cut perpendicular to the horizontal plane. 3Bath application of the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-[2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (GPP; 5 μm) elevated the threshold for evoking the giant EPSP. Higher concentrations (10-15 μm) reduced the amplitude and duration of the giant EPSP. Bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 5 μm) eliminated the evoked EPSP. 4In intact slices, superficial layer neurons of pre- and parasubiculum could exhibit EPSPs coincident with bursts recorded in the deep layers. However, in isolated subsections of horizontal slices or in ‘vertical slices’, both of which contained only pre- and/or parasubiculum, evoked or picrotoxin-induced bursts occurred only in deep layer cells. Superficial layer cells in these subsections showed no response to deep layer events. 5Antidromic population spikes confirmed projections from superficial cell layers of pre- and parasubiculum down to their deep cell layers. Reciprocal antidromic responses were absent. 6Axons of superficial layer stellate and pyramidal cells had horizontal collaterals and at least one ascending and one descending collateral. Branches of the descending collaterals were given off in layer V and some axons were found to reach the angular bundle. Axons of deep layer stellate and pyramidal cells also had horizontal collaterals and descending collaterals which could be traced to the angular bundle. One ascending axon collateral was found among the thirty-one deep layer cells examined morphologically. 7We conclude that the deep layer cells of the presubiculum and parasubiculum are richly interconnected with excitatory synapses. These interconnections can generate giant excitatory synaptic potentials that support the bursting behaviour exhibited by these neurons. Any of the excitatory inputs to deep layer cells can trigger the population bursts and specific inputs from entorhinal cortex produce the after-discharges. Further, connections between superficial and deep layer cells appear to be almost exclusively in the direction of superficial to deep. The absence of significant ascending input can account for the functional separation of superficial and deep layer neurons of presubiculum and parasubiculum.},

Recordings at multiple depths in the entorhinal cortex were first used to characterize field potentials evoked by stimulation of the parasubiculum in urethan-anesthetized rats. Current source density analysis showed that a prominent surface-negative field potential component is generated by synaptic activation in layer II. The surface-negative field potential was also observed in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The response was maintained during short stimulation trains of ≤125 Hz, suggesting that it is generated by activation of monosynaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex also projects to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and interactions between parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs were investigated using double-site stimulation tests. Simultaneous activation of parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs with high-intensity pulses resulted in smaller synaptic potentials than were expected on the basis of summing the individual responses, consistent with the termination of both pathways onto a common population of neurons. Paired-pulse tests were then used to assess the effect of parasubicular stimulation on responses to piriform cortex stimulation. Responses of the entorhinal cortex to piriform cortex inputs were inhibited when the parasubiculum was stimulated 5 ms earlier and were enhanced when the parasubiculum was stimulated 20–150 ms earlier. These results indicate that excitatory inputs to the entorhinal cortex from the parasubiculum may enhance the propagation of neuronal activation patterns into the hippocampal circuit by increasing the responsiveness of the entorhinal cortex to appropriately timed inputs.},

	abstract = {Recombinant Adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) are widely used for gene delivery and multiple naturally occurring serotypes have been harnessed to target cells in different tissues and organs including the brain. Here, we provide a detailed and quantitative analysis of the transduction profiles of rAAV vectors based on six of the most commonly used serotypes (AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8, AAV9) that allows systematic comparison and selection of the optimal vector for a specific application. In our studies we observed marked differences among serotypes in the efficiency to transduce three different brain regions namely the striatum, hippocampus and neocortex of the mouse. Despite the fact that the analyzed serotypes have the general ability to transduce all major cell types in the brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), the expression level of a reporter gene driven from a ubiquitous promoter varies significantly for specific cell type / serotype combinations. For example, rAAV8 is particularly efficient to drive transgene expression in astrocytes while rAAV9 appears well suited for the transduction of cortical neurons. Interestingly, we demonstrate selective retrograde transport of rAAV5 along axons projecting from the ventral part of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we show that self-complementing rAAV can be used to significantly decrease the time required for the onset of transgene expression in the mouse brain.},

The projections from the presubiculum were bilateral and confined to layers III and I of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Both the ipsi- and the contralateral projections showed similar distributions and were almost of equal density. Projections to layer III of the entorhinal cortex arose predominantly from superficial layers of the presubiculum, whereas the fibers that reach layer I of the entorhinal cortex appear to originate preferentially from the deep layers of the presubiculum. These fibers also appeared to innervate weakly layer II of MEA. The parasubiculum distributed projections not only to MEA but also to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), innervating layer II selectively. The innervation of LEA was quite dense and extensive. Very weak projections from the parasubiculum to the contralateral entorhinal cortex were observed in this study. The position of the terminal plexus in the entorhinal cortex was determined by the point of origin along both the dorsoventral and transverse or proximodistal axes of the presubiculum and parasubiculum. Projections from the presubiculum and parasubiculum entered the entorhinal cortex at the level of the injection, or slightly ventral to it, and the main terminal field was always present ventrally to the injection site. The dorsoventral axis of origin thus corresponded to a similarly oriented axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The distribution in relation to the origin along the transverse axis was more complex, and differences between the presubiculum and parasubiculum were present. The proximal presubiculum, i.e., the part closest to the subiculum, projected to the most lateral part of MEA and the central part of the presubiculum sent fibers to the most medial part of MEA. The distal part of the presubiculum, i.e., the part that borders the parasubiculum, projected to the central part of MEA. Projections from the portion of the parasubiculum directly adjacent to the presubiculum, the so-called proximal parasubiculum, reached medial parts of MEA, and those originating in the central part distributed preferentially to lateral parts of MEA and adjacent medial parts of LEA. The distal part of the parasubiculum that borders the entorhinal cortex projected mainly to almost the full mediolateral extent of LEA. The regional and laminar organizations of the projections from the presubiculum and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex suggest that information is selectively conveyed not only to different cell layers but also to restricted dorsoventral and mediolateral parts of the entorhinal cortex. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Patients with Wolfram syndrome display considerable clinical pleiomorphism, and symptoms such as neurological complications and psychiatric disorders are common. In the present study we have characterized Wfs1 expression pattern in the mouse central nervous system by using a combination of immunohistochemistry on wild-type mice and X-Gal staining of Wfs1 knockout mice with targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter. We identified a robust enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala and ventral striatum. Prominent Wfs1 expression was seen in the hippocampal CA1 region, parasubiculum, superficial part of the second and third layers of the prefrontal cortex and proisocortical areas, hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory system, and central auditory pathway. Wfs1 expression was also detected in numerous brainstem nuclei and in laminae VIII and IX of the spinal cord. Wfs1-positive nerve fibers were found in the medial forebrain bundle, reticular part of the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, posterior caudate putamen, lateral lemniscus, alveus, fimbria, dorsal hippocampal commissure, subiculum, and to a lesser extent in the central sublenticular extended amygdala, compact part of substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. The neuroanatomical findings suggest that the lack of Wfs1 protein function can be related to several neurological and psychiatric symptoms found in Wolfram syndrome.

Analysis of the PHAL injections that were relatively well restricted to single layers of the MEA reveals very sparse projections to the parasubiculum, presubiculum, and subiculum, while numerous projections within the MEA are found. The course and the termination of the intra-entorhinal projections differ depending upon the particular layer under study, and marked differences are found between the deep and the superficial layers in terms of the divergence of their respective projections. However, the general intra-entorhinal orientation of these projections is essentially the same for all layers: longitudinal with a slightly oblique course, such that at ventral levels the center of a particular terminal field is always located lateral -to the center of the respective PHA-L injection. PHA-L injections into layer II label axons running horizontally within this layer as well as within the deep part of layer I, and PHA-L injections into the medial sector of layer II reveal horizontal projections that innervate most of the second layer. The horizontal projections of layer III are more restricted than those of layer II but both layer U and III have prominent longitudinal projections directed ventrally. From layers II and III, numerous axons project to the deep layers (IV-VI) probably en route to extra-entorhinal structures, since no major terminal fields were detected in the deep layers. The PHA-L and the FB experiments show that the deep layers (in particular IV and VI) have far more divergent intra-entorhinal projections than have layers II and III. PHA-L injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the MEA in addition to projections to the Iateral EA. The retrograde transport studies show that layers IV and VI are the major sources of these divergent projections and that cells situated throughout the entire medial to lateral width of these layers project to every sector of the retrohippocampal region. Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that (1) all layers of the MEA have longitudinal projections, directed primarily toward the ventral (or temporal) part of this cortex, (2) the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers, and (3) the deep layers (in particular IV and VI) have highly divergent projections such that they reach most parts of layers II and III throughout the longitudinal axis of the MEA, in addition to their innervations of the lateral EA and to some degree the para- and presubiculum.},

	abstract = {The intrahippocampal projections of the subicular complex were studied in the rat with the aid of the anterogradely transported lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). After iontophoretic injections of the lectin into the subiculum proper, presubiculum, or the parasubiculum, axons and terminal processes immunoreactive for PHA-L were traced to their respective terminal fields within the hippocampal region. After subicular injections PHA-L-stained axons could be followed both in a caudal and a rostral direction. The caudally directed fibers course around or within the angular bundle to enter layers VI and V of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Many fibers penetrate through these layers to terminate in layer IV of the medial and the lateral entorhinal area, which contains a major terminal field of this projection. At more ventral levels, all layers of the entorhinal area are innervated by cells located in the subiculum. Other retrohippocampal projections of the subiculum proper include the deep and the outer two layers of the presubiculum and the medial sector of the parasubiculum, in addition to a massive projection which terminates in the retrosplenial cortex. The rostrally directed projections from the subiculum form a dense innervation of strata lacunosum, radiatum, oriens, and of individual pyramidal cells in the regio superior of the Ammon's horn. All these projections of the subiculum are exclusively ipsilateral. After injections of PHA-L into layers n and III of the presubiculum, both ipsi- and contralateral projections were traced to the outer three layers of the medial entorhinal area; the lateral entorhinal area apparently receives no innervation from the presubiculum. The innervation of layer III is very dense while in layer II and deep layer I, restricted zones of innervation are found. The fibers reach these layers via the deep layers of the MEA and through the molecular layer after first coursing around the parasubiculum. In addition, a minor projection from the presubiculum to the pyramidal cell layer of the subiculum and to the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation was found. PHA-L injections into the parasubiculum labeled fibers that form a dense innervation of layer II in the MEA and the medial part of the lateral EA, and of the most medial sector of layer III in the MEA. Layer I and the superficial part of layer II of the contralateral MEA also contain a dense terminal network after PHA-L injections into the parasubiculum. The commissural fibers reach the contralateral side via the dorsal hippocampal commissural system, the angular bundle, and finally through all layers of the contralateral EA. With the exception of a small projection to the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation, the parasubiculum appears not to innervate any of the other hippocampal subfields. Taken together, these studies have shown that each field of the subicular complex has projections restricted to separate layers of the entorhinal area, and thus, that each field participates in its own unique way in the control of entorhinal function.},

	abstract = {During the generation of higher-frequency (e.g., gamma) oscillations, cortical neurons can exhibit pairwise tight (\&lt;10 ms) spike synchrony. To understand how synaptic currents contribute to rhythmic activity and spike synchrony, we performed dual whole-cell recordings in mouse entorhinal cortical slices generating periodic activity (the slow oscillation). This preparation exhibited a significant amount of gamma-coherent spike synchrony during the active phase of the slow oscillation (Up state), particularly among fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. IPSCs arriving in pairs of either pyramidal or fast-spiking neurons during the Up state were highly synchronized and exhibited significant coherence at frequencies from 10 to 100 Hz, peaking at \&\#x223C;40 Hz, suggesting both synchronous discharge of, and synaptic divergence from, nearby inhibitory neurons. By inferring synaptic currents related to spike generation in simultaneously recorded pyramidal or fast-spiking neurons, we detected a decay of inhibition \&\#x223C;20 ms before spiking. In fast-spiking interneurons, this was followed by an even larger excitatory input immediately before spike generation. Consistent with an important role for phasic excitation in driving spiking, we found that the correlation of excitatory inputs was highly predictive of spike synchrony in pairs of fast-spiking interneurons. Interestingly, spike synchrony in fast-spiking interneurons was not related to the strength of gap junctional coupling, and was still prevalent in connexin 36 knock-out animals. Our results support the pyramidal-interneuron gamma model of fast rhythmic oscillation in the cerebral cortex and suggest that spike synchrony and phase preference arises from the precise interaction of excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic currents.},

Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of \&\#x223C;50-80 ms.

Each attractor corresponds to a single location, the representation of which sharpens over the course of several milliseconds, as the reactivation focuses at that location. Subsequently, the reactivation transitions rapidly to a spatially discontiguous location. This alternation between sharpening and transition occurs repeatedly within individual SWRs and is locked to the slow-gamma (25 to 50 hertz) rhythm. These findings support theoretical notions of neural network function and reveal a fundamental discretization in the retrieval of memory in the hippocampus, together with a function for gamma oscillations in the control of attractor dynamics.},

Joint measurements of cholinergic activity and neuronal network dynamics with high spatio-temporal resolution are critical to understand ACh neuromodulation. However, current electrochemical biosensors are not optimized to measure nanomolar cholinergic signals across small regions like hippocampal sub-layers. Here, we report a novel oxidase-based electrochemical biosensor that matches these constraints. The approach is based on measurement of H2O2 generated by choline oxidase (ChOx) in the presence of choline (Ch). The microelectrode design consists of a twisted pair of 50\&\#xB5;m diameter Pt/Ir wires (sensor and sentinel), which is scalable, provides high spatial resolution and optimizes common mode rejection. Microelectrode coating with ChOx in chitosan cross-linked with benzoquinone is simple, mechanically robust and provides high sensitivity (324\&\#xB1;46nA\&\#xB5;M(-1)cm(-2)), a limit of detection of 16nM and a t50 response time of 1.4s. Local field potential (LFP)-related currents dominate high-frequency component of electrochemical recordings in vivo. We significantly improved signal-to-noise-ratio compared to traditional sentinel subtraction by a novel frequency domain common mode rejection procedure that accounts for differential phase and amplitude of LFP-related currents on the two channels. We demonstrate measurements of spontaneous nanomolar Ch fluctuations, on top of which micromolar Ch increases occurred during periods of theta activity in anesthetized rats. Measurements were not affected by physiological O2 changes, in agreement with the low biosensor Km for O2 (2.6\&\#xB5;M). Design and performance of the novel biosensor opens the way for multisite recordings of spontaneous cholinergic dynamics in behaving animals.},

	abstract = {Aging is accompanied by a complicated pattern of changes in the brain organization and often by alterations in specific memory functions. One of the brain activities with important role in the process of memory consolidation is thought to be the hippocampus activity of sharp waves and ripple oscillation (SWRs). Using field recordings from the CA1 area of hippocampal slices we compared SWRs as well as single pyramidal cell activity between adult (3-6-month old) and old (24-34-month old) Wistar rats. The slices from old rats displayed ripple oscillation with a significantly less number of ripples and lower frequency compared with those from adult animals. However, the hippocampus from old rats had significantly higher propensity to organized SWRs in long sequences. Furthermore, the bursts recorded from complex spike cells in slices from old compared with adult rats displayed higher number of spikes and longer mean inter-spike interval. Blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) increased the amplitude of both sharp waves and ripples and increased the interval between events of SWRs in both age groups. On the contrary, CPP reduced the probability of occurrence of sequences of SWRs more strongly in slices from adult than old rats. Blockade of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels by nifedipine only enhanced the amplitude of sharp waves in slices from adult rats. CPP increased the postsynaptic excitability and the paired-pulse inhibition in slices from both adult and old rats similarly while nifedipine increased the postsynaptic excitability only in slices from adult rats. We propose that the tendency of the aged hippocampus to generate long sequences of SWR events might represent the consequence of homeostatic mechanisms that adaptively try to compensate the impairment in the ripple oscillation in order to maintain the behavioral outcome efficient in the old individuals. The age-dependent alterations in the firing mode of pyramidal cells might underlie to some extent the changes in ripples that occur in old animals.},

	abstract = {There is continuing controversy relating to the primary afferent neurotransmitter that conveys itch signals to the spinal cord. Here, we investigated the DRG and spinal cord expression of the putative primary afferent-derived "itch" neurotransmitter, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Using ISH, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry, we conclude that GRP is expressed abundantly in spinal cord, but not in DRG neurons. Titration of the most commonly used GRP antiserum in tissues from wild-type and GRP mutant mice indicates that the antiserum is only selective for GRP at high dilutions. Paralleling these observations, we found that a GRPeGFP transgenic reporter mouse has abundant expression in superficial dorsal horn neurons, but not in the DRG. In contrast to previous studies, neither dorsal rhizotomy nor an intrathecal injection of capsaicin, which completely eliminated spinal cord TRPV1-immunoreactive terminals, altered dorsal horn GRP immunoreactivity. Unexpectedly, however, peripheral nerve injury induced significant GRP expression in a heterogeneous population of DRG neurons. Finally, dual labeling and retrograde tracing studies showed that GRP-expressing neurons of the superficial dorsal horn are predominantly interneurons, that a small number coexpress protein kinase C gamma (PKC\&\#x3B3;), but that none coexpress the GRP receptor (GRPR). Our studies support the view that pruritogens engage spinal cord "itch" circuits via excitatory superficial dorsal horn interneurons that express GRP and that likely target GRPR-expressing interneurons. The fact that peripheral nerve injury induced de novo GRP expression in DRG neurons points to a novel contribution of this peptide to pruritoceptive processing in neuropathic itch conditions.},

We tested the specificity of the GRP antibody by preincubating with peptides with which it could potentially cross-react. We also examined tissue from a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under control of the GRP promoter.},

	abstract = {The putative excitatory and inhibitory cell classes within the mouse primary visual cortex V1 have different functional properties as studied using recording microelectrode. Excitatory neurons show high selectivity for the orientation angle of moving gratings while the putative inhibitory neurons show poor selectivity. However, the study of selectivity of the genetically identified interneurons and their subtypes remain controversial. Here we use novel Cre-driver and reporter mice to identify genetic subpopulations in vivo for two-photon calcium dye imaging: Wfs1(+)/Gad1(-) mice that labels layer 2/3 excitatory cell population and Pvalb(+)/Gad1(+) mice that labels a genetic subpopulation of inhibitory neurons. The cells in both mice were identically labeled with a tdTomato protein, visible in vivo, using a Cre-reporter line. We found that the Wfs1(+) cells exhibited visual tuning properties comparable to the excitatory population, i.e., high selectivity and tuning to the angle, direction, and spatial frequency of oriented moving gratings. The functional tuning of Pvalb(+) neurons was consistent with previously reported narrow-spiking interneurons in microelectrode studies, exhibiting poorer selectivity than the excitatory neurons. This study demonstrates the utility of Cre-transgenic mouse technology in selective targeting of subpopulations of neurons and makes them amenable to structural, functional, and connectivity studies.},

The UBC brush and a single mossy fiber (MF) terminal contact each other within a cerebellar glomerulus, forming a giant synapse. Many UBCs receive input from extrinsic MFs, whereas others are innervated by intrinsic mossy terminals formed by the axons of other UBCs. In all mammalian species so far examined, the vestibulocerebellum is enriched of UBCs that are strongly immunoreactive for the calcium binding protein calretinin (CR) in both the somatodendritic and axonal compartment. UBCs have postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors and extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors that immunocytochemically highlight their somatodendritic compartment and brush, respectively. In this study on the mouse cerebellum, we present evidence that immunoreactivities to CR and mGluR1alpha define two distinct UBC subsets with partly overlapping distributions in lobule X (the nodulus). In sections double-labeled for CR and mGluR1alpha, the patterns of distributions of CR(+)/mGluR1alpha(-) UBCs and CR(-)/mGluR1alpha(+) UBCs differed along the mediolateral and dorsoventral axes of the folium. Moreover, mGluR1alpha(+) UBCs outnumbered CR(+) UBCs. Both UBC subsets were mGluR2/3, GluR2/3, and NMDAR1 immunoreactive. The different distribution patterns of the two UBC subsets within lobule X suggest that expression of CR or mGluR1alpha by UBCs may be afferent-specific and related to the terminal fields of different vestibular MF afferents.},

Numerous studies suggest the existence of two regions that have been termed core and shell. At a gross level, differences between these regions map to distinct functional differences, although the specific role(s) of various peptidergic cellular phenotypes remains unknown. In mouse, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) cells lie in the core, are directly retinorecipient, and lack detectable rhythmicity in clock gene expression, raising interest in their role in the SCN. Here, we provide evidence that calbindin-expressing cells of perinatal mouse SCN express GRP, identified by a green fluorescent protein (GFP+), but lack detectable calbindin later in development. To explore the intra-SCN network in which GRP neurons participate, individual GFP+ cells were filled with tracer and their morphological characteristics, processes, and connections, as well as those of their non-GFP-containing immediate neighbors, were compared. The results show that GFP+ neurons form a dense network of local circuits within the core, revealed by appositions on other GFP+ cells and by the presence of dye-coupled cells. Dendrites and axons of GFP+ cells make appositions on arginine vasopressin neurons, whereas non-GFP cells have a less extensive fiber network, largely confined to the region of GFP+ cells. The results point to specialized circuitry within the SCN, presumably supporting synchronization of neural activity and reciprocal communication between core and shell regions.},

Bath application of bombesin concentration-dependently increased both the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs recorded from the principal neurons in the EC. Application of NMB and GRP exerted the same effects as bombesin. Bombesin had no effects on mIPSCs recorded in the presence of TTX but slightly depressed the evoked IPSCs. Omission of extracellular Ca(2+) or inclusion of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blockers, Cd(2+) and Ni(2+), blocked bombesin-induced increases in sIPSCs suggesting that bombesin increases GABA release via facilitating extracellular Ca(2+) influx. Bombesin induced membrane depolarization and slightly increased the input resistance of GABAergic interneurons recorded from layer III of the EC. The action potential firing frequency of the interneurons was also increased by bombesin. Bombesin-mediated depolarization of interneurons was unlikely to be mediated by the opening of a cationic conductance but due to the inhibition of inward rectifier K(+) channels. Bath application of bombesin, NMB and GRP depressed the frequency of the epileptiform activity elicited by deprivation of Mg(2+) from the extracellular solution suggesting that bombesin and the bombesin-like peptides have antiepileptic effects in the brain.},

Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations.},

To determine whether other hippocampal firing characteristics depend more critically on MEC inputs, we recorded from hippocampal CA1 cells in rats with MEC lesions.

Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.},

We found that the pattern of presubiculo-entorhinal projections differs between the superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum. The superficial layers (layers II and III) of the presubiculum gave rise to bilateral projections to layers I–VI of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Many terminals were distributed in layer III, fewer in layer II and the deep portion of layer I, and many fewer terminals in the deep layers (layers V and VI) of MEA. In contrast, the deep layers (layers V and VI) of the presubiculum gave rise to ipsilateral projections to the entorhinal area. Many axon terminals were distributed in layers V and VI of MEA and the most superficial portion of layer I of MEA, but very few in layers II and III. In addition, the ramifications in layer I extended to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA). Using two-dimensional unfolded maps of parahippocampal cortices, we elucidated the distinct topographical relationship in the presubiculo-entorhinal projection: 1) The septotemporal or longitudinal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis on the MEA/LEA boundary, where the septal presubiculum projected toward the rhinal fissure and the temporal presubiculum projected away from the fissure. 2) The proximodistal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis from the MEA/LEA boundary to the MEA/parasubiculum boundary that was virtually perpendicular to the MEA/LEA boundary, where the proximal portion of the presubiculum (close to the subiculum) projected to the region near the MEA/LEA boundary.

We also find that the effects of nonlinear correlation transfer on cortical responses are stronger in the synchronized state than in the desynchronized state, and show that they can be reproduced and understood in a model with a simple threshold nonlinearity.

	abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the reliable propagation of synchronous neural activity is crucial for neural information processing. The propagation of synchronous firing activity in so-called synfire chains has been studied extensively in feed-forward networks of spiking neurons. However, it remains unclear how such neural activity could emerge in recurrent neuronal networks through synaptic plasticity. In this study, we investigate whether local excitation, i.e., neurons that fire at a higher frequency than the other, spontaneously active neurons in the network, can shape a network to allow for synchronous activity propagation. We use two-dimensional, locally connected and heterogeneous neuronal networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that, in our model, local excitation drives profound network changes within seconds. In the emergent network, neural activity propagates synchronously through the network. This activity originates from the site of the local excitation and propagates through the network. The synchronous activity propagation persists, even when the local excitation is removed, since it derives from the synaptic weight matrix. Importantly, once this connectivity is established it remains stable even in the presence of spontaneous activity. Our results suggest that synfire-chain-like activity can emerge in a relatively simple way in realistic neural networks by locally exciting the desired origin of the neuronal sequence.},

	abstract = {Neuron encodes and transmits information through generating sequences of output spikes, which is a high energy-consuming process. The spike is initiated when membrane depolarization reaches a threshold voltage. In many neurons, threshold is dynamic and depends on the rate of membrane depolarization (dV/dt) preceding a spike. Identifying the metabolic energy involved in neural coding and their relationship to threshold dynamic is critical to understanding neuronal function and evolution. Here, we use a modified Morris-Lecar model to investigate neuronal input-output property and energy efficiency associated with different spike threshold dynamics. We find that the neurons with dynamic threshold sensitive to dV/dt generate discontinuous frequency-current curve and type II phase response curve (PRC) through Hopf bifurcation, and weak noise could prohibit spiking when bifurcation just occurs. The threshold that is insensitive to dV/dt, instead, results in a continuous frequency-current curve, a type I PRC and a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation, and simultaneously weak noise cannot inhibit spiking. It is also shown that the bifurcation, frequency-current curve and PRC type associated with different threshold dynamics arise from the distinct subthreshold interactions of membrane currents. Further, we observe that the energy consumption of the neuron is related to its firing characteristics. The depolarization of spike threshold improves neuronal energy efficiency by reducing the overlap of Na+ and K+ currents during an action potential. The high energy efficiency is achieved at more depolarized spike threshold and high stimulus current. These results provide a fundamental biophysical connection that links spike threshold dynamics, input-output relation, energetics and spike initiation, which could contribute to uncover neural encoding mechanism.},

The repetitive burst firing of TC neurons at delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) has been linked to the oscillations recorded during deep sleep and during episodes of absence seizures. To get insight into the biophysical properties that are the basis for intrinsic delta oscillations in these neurons, we performed a bifurcation analysis of a minimal conductance-based thalamocortical neuron model including only the IT channel and the sodium and potassium leak channels. This analysis unveils the dynamics of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons, and describes how the interplay between the amplifying variable mT and the recovering variable hT of the calcium channel IT is sufficient to generate low threshold oscillations in the delta band. We also explored the role of the hyperpolarization activated cationic current Ih in this reduced model and determine that, albeit not required, Ih amplifies and stabilizes the oscillation.},

Network responsiveness is reflected as residency in, or shifting amongst, areas of the latency-decay plane. The different sensitivities of latency and decay durations to synaptic blockers imply that these two measures reflect aspects of inhibitory and excitatory activities. Taken together, the data suggest that trial-to-trial variations in the synchronized responses of neural networks might be related to effective excitation-inhibition ratio being a dynamic variable over time scales of minutes.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2014.00159},
	abstract = {A spiking neural network model is described for learning to discriminate among spatial patterns in an unsupervised manner. The network anatomy consists of source neurons that are activated by external inputs, a reservoir that resembles a generic cortical layer with an excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network and a sink layer of neurons for readout. Synaptic plasticity in the form of STDP is imposed on all the excitatory and inhibitory synapses at all times. While long-term excitatory STDP enables sparse and efficient learning of the salient features in inputs, inhibitory STDP enables this learning to be stable by establishing a balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents at each neuron in the network. The synaptic weights between source and reservoir neurons form a basis set for the input patterns. The neural trajectories generated in the reservoir due to input stimulation and lateral connections between reservoir neurons can be readout by the sink layer neurons. This activity is used for adaptation of synapses between reservoir and sink layer neurons. A new measure called the discriminability index (DI) is introduced to compute if the network can discriminate between old patterns already presented in an initial training session. The DI is also used to compute if the network adapts to new patterns without losing its ability to discriminate among old patterns. The final outcome is that the network is able to correctly discriminate between all patterns – both old and new. This result holds as long as inhibitory synapses employ STDP to continuously enable current balance in the network. The results suggest a possible direction for future investigation into how spiking neural networks could address the stability-plasticity question despite having continuous synaptic plasticity.},

We demonstrate consistency with previous work by leveraging the power of our characterization to replicate the functional volumes that are integral for the previous network stabilization results. We then use our characterization to predict the precise transitional point from the facilitating regime to the depressing regime in a simulated synapse, suggesting in vitro experiments to verify the underlying STP model. We conclude the work by integrating our characterization into a framework for finding suitable STP parameters for self-sustaining random, asynchronous activity in a prescribed recurrent spiking neural network.

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2014.00139},
	abstract = {To study the effects of stochastic ion channel fluctuations on neural dynamics, several numerical implementation methods have been proposed. Gillespie's method for Markov Chains (MC) simulation is highly accurate, yet it becomes computationally intensive in the regime of a high number of channels. Many recent works aim to speed simulation time using the Langevin-based Diffusion Approximation (DA). Under this common theoretical approach, each implementation differs in how it handles various numerical difficulties—such as bounding of state variables to [0,1]. Here we review and test a set of the most recently published DA implementations (Goldwyn et al., 2011; Linaro et al., 2011; Dangerfield et al., 2012; Orio and Soudry, 2012; Schmandt and Galán, 2012; Güler, 2013; Huang et al., 2013a), comparing all of them in a set of numerical simulations that assess numerical accuracy and computational efficiency on three different models: (1) the original Hodgkin and Huxley model, (2) a model with faster sodium channels, and (3) a multi-compartmental model inspired in granular cells. We conclude that for a low number of channels (usually below 1000 per simulated compartment) one should use MC—which is the fastest and most accurate method. For a high number of channels, we recommend using the method by Orio and Soudry (2012), possibly combined with the method by Schmandt and Galán (2012) for increased speed and slightly reduced accuracy. Consequently, MC modeling may be the best method for detailed multicompartment neuron models—in which a model neuron with many thousands of channels is segmented into many compartments with a few hundred channels.},

Different types of stationary or non-stationary noise analysis have been used in electrophysiological experiments for identification of channels kinetic states. But these methods have a limited power and often cannot answer to the main question of the experimental study: do external factors induce a significant change of channels kinetics? A new method suggested in the current study is based on the scaling properties of the beta-distribution function that allows reducing the series containing 200,000 and more data points to analysis of only 10–20 stable parameters. The following clusterization using the generalized Pearson correlation function allows taking into account the influence of an external factor and combine/separate different parameters of interest into a statistical cluster considering the influential parameter. This method which we call BRC (Beta distribution-Reduction-Clusterization) opens new possibilities in creation of a largely reduced database while extracting specific fingerprints of the long-term series. The BRC method was validated using patch clamp current recordings containing 250,000 data points obtained from the living cells and from open tip electrode. The numerical distinction between these two series in terms of the reduced parameters was obtained.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2014.00104},
	abstract = {A major source of random variability in cortical networks is the quasi-random arrival of presynaptic action potentials from many other cells. In network studies as well as in the study of the response properties of single cells embedded in a network, synaptic background input is often approximated by Poissonian spike trains. However, the output statistics of the cells is in most cases far from being Poisson. This is inconsistent with the assumption of similar spike-train statistics for pre- and postsynaptic cells in a recurrent network. Here we tackle this problem for the popular class of integrate-and-fire neurons and study a self-consistent statistics of input and output spectra of neural spike trains. Instead of actually using a large network, we use an iterative scheme, in which we simulate a single neuron over several generations. In each of these generations, the neuron is stimulated with surrogate stochastic input that has a similar statistics as the output of the previous generation. For the surrogate input, we employ two distinct approximations: (i) a superposition of renewal spike trains with the same interspike interval density as observed in the previous generation and (ii) a Gaussian current with a power spectrum proportional to that observed in the previous generation. For input parameters that correspond to balanced input in the network, both the renewal and the Gaussian iteration procedure converge quickly and yield comparable results for the self-consistent spike-train power spectrum. We compare our results to large-scale simulations of a random sparsely connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (Brunel, 2000) and show that in the asynchronous regime close to a state of balanced synaptic input from the network, our iterative schemes provide an excellent approximations to the autocorrelation of spike trains in the recurrent network.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons receive barrages of excitatory and inhibitory inputs which are not independent, as network structure and synaptic kinetics impose statistical correlations. Experiments in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated correlations between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in which inhibition lags behind excitation in cortical neurons. This delay arises in feed-forward inhibition (FFI) circuits and ensures that coincident excitation and inhibition do not preclude neuronal firing. Conversely, inhibition that is too delayed broadens neuronal integration times, thereby diminishing spike-time precision and increasing the firing frequency. This led us to hypothesize that the correlation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs modulates the encoding of information of neural spike trains. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of such correlations on the information rate (IR) of spike trains using the Hodgkin-Huxley model in which both synaptic and membrane conductances are stochastic. We investigated two different synaptic input regimes: balanced synaptic conductances and balanced currents. Our results show that correlations arising from the synaptic kinetics, \&\#x3C4;, and millisecond lags, \&\#x3B4;, of inhibition relative to excitation strongly affect the IR of spike trains. In the regime of balanced synaptic currents, for short time lags (\&\#x3B4; {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 1 ms) there is an optimal \&\#x3C4; that maximizes the IR of the postsynaptic spike train. Given the short time scales for monosynaptic inhibitory lags and synaptic decay kinetics reported in cortical neurons under physiological contexts, we propose that FFI in cortical circuits is poised to maximize the rate of information transfer between cortical neurons. Our results also provide a possible explanation for how certain drugs and genetic mutations affecting the synaptic kinetics can deteriorate information processing in the brain.},

Here, we demonstrate by analytical and numerical methods that iSTDP contributes crucially to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory weights for the selection of a specific signaling pathway among other pathways in a feedforward circuit. This pathway selection is based on the high sensitivity of STDP to correlations in spike times, which complements a recent proposal for the role of iSTDP in firing-rate based selection. Our model predicts that asymmetric anti-Hebbian iSTDP exceeds asymmetric Hebbian iSTDP for supporting pathway-specific balance, which we show is useful for propagating transient neuronal responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate how STDPs at excitatory-excitatory, excitatory-inhibitory, and inhibitory-excitatory synapses cooperate to improve the pathway selection. We propose that iSTDP is crucial for shaping the network structure that achieves efficient processing of synchronous spikes.},

	abstract = {Some neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) fire bursts when the animal occupies locations organized in a hexagonal grid pattern in their spatial environment. Place cells have also been observed, firing bursts only when the animal occupies a particular region of the environment. Both of these types of cells exhibit theta-cycle modulation, firing bursts in the 4–12 Hz range. Grid cells fire bursts of action potentials that precess with respect to the theta cycle, a phenomenon dubbed “theta precession.” Various models have been proposed to explain these phenomena, and how they relate to navigation. Among the most promising are the oscillator interference models. The bank-of-oscillators model proposed by Welday et al. (2011) exhibits all these features. However, their simulations are based on theoretical oscillators, and not implemented entirely with spiking neurons. We extend their work in a number of ways. First, we place the oscillators in a frequency domain and reformulate the model in terms of Fourier theory. Second, this perspective suggests a division of labor for implementing spatial maps: position vs. map layout. The animal's position is encoded in the phases of the oscillators, while the spatial map shape is encoded implicitly in the weights of the connections between the oscillators and the read-out nodes. Third, it reveals that the oscillator phases all need to conform to a linear relationship across the frequency domain. Fourth, we implement a partial model of the EC using spiking leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Fifth, we devise new coupling mechanisms, enlightened by the global phase constraint, and show they are capable of keeping spiking neural oscillators in consistent formation. Our model demonstrates place cells, grid cells, and phase precession. The Fourier model also gives direction for future investigations, such as integrating sensory feedback to combat drift, or explaining why grid cells exist at all.},

In numerical analysis, this is a classic stiff problem. Spiking neurons are also much more difficult to study analytically. One possible approach to making spiking networks more tractable is to augment mean field activity models with some information about spiking correlations. For example, such a generalized activity model could carry information about spiking rates and correlations between spikes self-consistently. Here, we will show how this can be accomplished by constructing a complete formal probabilistic description of the network and then expanding around a small parameter such as the inverse of the number of neurons in the network. The mean field theory of the system gives a rate-like description. The first order terms in the perturbation expansion keep track of covariances.},

However, they are sensitive to the action potentials of single neurons as suggested by recent single-cell stimulation experiments that reported quantifiable behavioral responses in response to short spike trains elicited in single neurons. Hence, these networks are stable against internally generated fluctuations in firing rate but at the same time remain sensitive to similarly-sized externally induced perturbations. We investigated stability and sensitivity in a simple recurrent network of stochastic binary neurons and determined numerically the effects of correlation between the number of afferent ("in-degree") and efferent ("out-degree") connections in neurons. The key advance reported in this work is that anti-correlation between in-/out-degree distributions increased the stability of the network in comparison to networks with no correlation or positive correlations, while being able to achieve the same level of sensitivity. The experimental characterization of degree distributions is difficult because all pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons have to be identified and counted. We explored whether the statistics of network motifs, which requires the characterization of connections between small subsets of neurons, could be used to detect evidence for degree anti-correlations. We find that the sample frequency of the 3-neuron "ring" motif (1\&\#x2192;2\&\#x2192;3\&\#x2192;1), can be used to detect degree anti-correlation for sub-networks of size 30 using about 50 samples, which is of significance because the necessary measurements are achievable experimentally in the near future.

To understand how individual fibers fire synchronously, we establish "oligofiber recording techniques" to record "several" nerve fiber activities simultaneously, using in vitro splanchnic sympathetic nerve-thoracic spinal cord preparations of neonatal rats as experimental models. While distinct spike potentials were easily recorded from collagenase-dissociated sympathetic fibers, a problem arising from synchronous nerve discharges is a higher incidence of complex waveforms resulted from spike overlapping. Because commercial softwares do not provide an explicit solution for spike overlapping, a series of custom-made LabVIEW programs incorporated with MATLAB scripts was therefore written for spike sorting. Spikes were represented as data points after waveform feature extraction and automatically grouped by k-means clustering followed by principal component analysis (PCA) to verify their waveform homogeneity. For dissimilar waveforms with exceeding Hotelling's T(2) distances from the cluster centroids, a unique data-based subtraction algorithm (SA) was used to determine if they were the complex waveforms resulted from superimposing a spike pattern close to the cluster centroid with the other signals that could be observed in original recordings. In comparisons with commercial software, higher accuracy was achieved by analyses using our algorithms for the synthetic data that contained synchronous spiking and complex waveforms. Moreover, both T(2)-selected and SA-retrieved spikes were combined as unit activities. Quantitative analyses were performed to evaluate if unit activities truly originated from single fibers. We conclude that applications of our programs can help to resolve synchronous sympathetic nerve discharges (SND).},

This search outputs the occurrence count (support) of individual patterns that are not trivially explained by the counts of any superset (closed frequent item sets). The number of patterns found by FIM makes direct statistical tests infeasible due to severe multiple testing. To overcome this issue, we proposed to test the significance not of individual patterns, but instead of their signatures, defined as the pairs of pattern size z and support c. Here, we derive in detail a statistical test for the significance of the signatures under the null hypothesis of full independence (pattern spectrum filtering, PSF) by means of surrogate data. As a result, injected spike patterns that mimic assembly activity are well detected, yielding a low false negative rate. However, this approach is prone to additionally classify patterns resulting from chance overlap of real assembly activity and background spiking as significant. These patterns represent false positives with respect to the null hypothesis of having one assembly of given signature embedded in otherwise independent spiking activity. We propose the additional method of pattern set reduction (PSR) to remove these false positives by conditional filtering. By employing stochastic simulations of parallel spike trains with correlated activity in form of injected spike synchrony in subsets of the neurons, we demonstrate for a range of parameter settings that the analysis scheme composed of FIM, PSF and PSR allows to reliably detect active assemblies in massively parallel spike trains.},

We used four cell types from the crab stomatogastric ganglion: the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, gastric mill, and dorsal gastric neurons. Each neuron was evaluated for six conventional measures of intrinsic excitability (intrinsic properties, IPs). Additionally, each neuron was coupled by reciprocal inhibitory synapses made with the dynamic clamp to a Morris-Lecar model neuron and the resulting network was assayed for four measures of network activity (network activity properties, NAPs). We searched for linear combinations of IPs that correlated with each NAP, and combinations of NAPs that correlated with each IP. In the process we developed a method to correct for multiple correlations while searching for correlating features. When properly controlled for multiple correlations, four of the IPs were correlated with NAPs, and all four NAPs were correlated with IPs. Neurons were classified into cell types by training a linear classifier on sets of properties, or using k-medoids clustering. The IPs were modestly successful in classifying the neurons, and the NAPs were more successful. Combining the two measures did better than either measure alone, but not well enough to classify neurons with perfect accuracy, thus reiterating that electrophysiological measures of single-cell properties alone are not sufficient for reliable cell identification.},

	abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory coherence is believed to play a central role in flexible communication between brain circuits. To test this communication-through-coherence hypothesis, experimental protocols that allow a reliable control of phase-relations between neuronal populations are needed. In this modeling study, we explore the potential of closed-loop optogenetic stimulation for the control of functional interactions mediated by oscillatory coherence. The theory of non-linear oscillators predicts that the efficacy of local stimulation will depend not only on the stimulation intensity but also on its timing relative to the ongoing oscillation in the target area. Induced phase-shifts are expected to be stronger when the stimulation is applied within specific narrow phase intervals. Conversely, stimulations with the same or even stronger intensity are less effective when timed randomly. Stimulation should thus be properly phased with respect to ongoing oscillations (in order to optimally perturb them) and the timing of the stimulation onset must be determined by a real-time phase analysis of simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Here, we introduce an electrophysiologically calibrated model of Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-induced photocurrents, based on fits holding over two decades of light intensity. Through simulations of a neural population which undergoes coherent gamma oscillations-either spontaneously or as an effect of continuous optogenetic driving-we show that precisely-timed photostimulation pulses can be used to shift the phase of oscillation, even at transduction rates smaller than 25\%. We consider then a canonic circuit with two inter-connected neural populations oscillating with gamma frequency in a phase-locked manner. We demonstrate that photostimulation pulses applied locally to a single population can induce, if precisely phased, a lasting reorganization of the phase-locking pattern and hence modify functional interactions between the two populations.},

	abstract = {In spite of over a century of research on cortical circuits, it is still unknown how many classes of cortical neurons exist. In fact, neuronal classification is a difficult problem because it is unclear how to designate a neuronal cell class and what are the best characteristics to define them. Recently, unsupervised classifications using cluster analysis based on morphological, physiological, or molecular characteristics, have provided quantitative and unbiased identification of distinct neuronal subtypes, when applied to selected datasets. However, better and more robust classification methods are needed for increasingly complex and larger datasets. Here, we explored the use of affinity propagation, a recently developed unsupervised classification algorithm imported from machine learning, which gives a representative example or exemplar for each cluster. As a case study, we applied affinity propagation to a test dataset of 337 interneurons belonging to four subtypes, previously identified based on morphological and physiological characteristics. We found that affinity propagation correctly classified most of the neurons in a blind, non-supervised manner. Affinity propagation outperformed Ward's method, a current standard clustering approach, in classifying the neurons into 4 subtypes. Affinity propagation could therefore be used in future studies to validly classify neurons, as a first step to help reverse engineer neural circuits.},

	abstract = {Oscillations in the coordinated firing of brain neurons have been proposed to play important roles in perception, cognition, attention, learning, navigation, and sensory-motor control. The network theta rhythm has been associated with properties of spatial navigation, as has the firing of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells. Two recent studies reduced the theta rhythm by inactivating the medial septum (MS) and demonstrated a correlated reduction in the characteristic hexagonal spatial firing patterns of grid cells. These results, along with properties of intrinsic membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) in slice preparations of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), have been interpreted to support oscillatory interference models of grid cell firing. The current article shows that an alternative self-organizing map (SOM) model of grid cells can explain these data about intrinsic and network oscillations without invoking oscillatory interference. In particular, the adverse effects of MS inactivation on grid cells can be understood in terms of how the concomitant reduction in cholinergic inputs may increase the conductances of leak potassium (K+) and slow and medium after-hyperpolarization (sAHP and mAHP) channels. This alternative model can also explain data that are problematic for oscillatory interference models, including how knockout of the HCN1 gene in mice, which flattens the dorsoventral gradient in MPO frequency and resonance frequency, does not affect the development of the grid cell dorsoventral gradient of spatial scales, and how hexagonal grid firing fields in bats can occur even in the absence of theta band modulation. These results demonstrate how models of grid cell self-organization can provide new insights into the relationship between brain learning and oscillatory dynamics.},

	abstract = {Memory formation is associated with the generation of transiently stable neuronal assemblies. In hippocampal networks, such groups of functionally coupled neurons express highly ordered spatiotemporal activity patterns which are coordinated by local network oscillations. One of these patterns, sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-R), repetitively activates previously established groups of memory-encoding neurons, thereby supporting memory consolidation. This function implies that repetition of specific SPW-R induces plastic changes which render the underlying neuronal assemblies more stable. We modeled this repetitive activation in an in vitro model of SPW-R in mouse hippocampal slices. Weak electrical stimulation upstream of the CA3-CA1 networks reliably induced SPW-R of stereotypic waveform, thus representing re-activation of similar neuronal activity patterns. Frequent repetition of these patterns (100 times) reduced the variance of both, evoked and spontaneous SPW-R waveforms, indicating stabilization of pre-existing assemblies. These effects were most pronounced in the CA1 subfield and depended on the timing of stimulation relative to spontaneous SPW-R. Additionally, plasticity of SPW-R was blocked by application of a NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting a role for associative synaptic plasticity in this process. Thus, repetitive activation of specific patterns of SPW-R causes stabilization of memory-related networks.},

Selective optogenetic inhibition of SOM responses blocked desynchronization and decorrelation, demonstrating that direct cholinergic activation of SOM neurons is necessary for this phenomenon. Optogenetic inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons did not block desynchronization, despite these neurons being activated at high levels of cholinergic drive. Direct optogenetic SOM activation, independent of cholinergic modulation, was sufficient to induce desynchronization. Together, these findings demonstrate a mechanistic basis for temporal structure in cortical populations and the crucial role of neuromodulatory drive in specific inhibitory-excitatory circuits in actively shaping the dynamics of neuronal activity.},

To address this issue, whole-cell patch recordings and neuronal reconstructions were performed on rat brain slices containing the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB). Slow firing neurons were identified by their low firing rate at threshold (\&lt;5 Hz) and lack of time-dependent inward rectification (Ih). Unsupervised cluster analysis was used to investigate whether slow firing neurons could be further classified into different subtypes. The parameters used for the cluster analysis included latency for first spike, slow after-hyperpolarizing potential, maximal frequency and action potential (AP) decay slope. Neurons were grouped into three major subtypes. The majority of neurons (55\%) were grouped as cluster I. Cluster II (17\% of neurons) exhibited longer latency for generation of the first action potential (246.5+/-20.1 ms). Cluster III (28\% of neurons) exhibited higher maximal firing frequency (25.3+/-1.7 Hz) when compared with cluster I (12.3+/-0.9 Hz) and cluster II (11.8+/-1.1 Hz) neurons. Additionally, cluster III neurons exhibited faster action potentials at suprathreshold. Interestingly, cluster II neurons were frequently located in the medial septum whereas neurons in cluster I and III appeared scattered throughout all MS/DB regions. Sholl's analysis revealed a more complex dendritic arborization in cluster III neurons. Cluster I and II neurons exhibited characteristics of "true" slow firing neurons whereas cluster III neurons exhibited higher frequency firing patterns. Several neurons were labeled with a cholinergic marker, Cy3-conjugated 192 IgG (p75NTR), and cholinergic neurons were found to be distributed among the three clusters. Our findings indicate that slow firing medial septal neurons are heterogeneous and that soma location is an important determinant of their electrophysiological properties. Thus, slow firing neurons from different septal regions have distinct functional properties, most likely related to their diverse connectivity.},

	abstract = {The two neuronal populations that have been typically investigated in the septum use acetylcholine and GABA as neurotransmitters. The existence of noncholinergic, non-GABAergic, most likely glutamatergic septal neurons has recently been reported. However, their morphological characteristics, numbers, distribution, and connectivity have not been determined. Furthermore, the projection of septal glutamatergic neurons to the hippocampus has not been characterized. To address these issues, subpopulations of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was injected into the hippocampus to determine the characteristics of a glutamatergic septo-hippocampal projection. Our work revealed that although glutamatergic neurons are found throughout the septum, they concentrate in medial septal regions. Using stereological probes, approximately 16,000 glutamatergic neurons were estimated in the medial septal region. Triple immunostaining showed that most glutamatergic neurons do not immunoreact with cholinergic or GABAergic neuronal markers (anti-ChAT or anti-GAD67 antibodies, respectively). Fluorogold injections into CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that septal glutamatergic neurons project to each of these hippocampal regions, forming ∼23\% of the septo-hippocampal projection. Most cell bodies of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic neurons were located in the medial septum. The remaining cell bodies were found in the diagonal band. This data shows that glutamatergic neurons constitute a significant neuronal population in the septum and that a subpopulation of these neurons projects to hippocampal regions. Thus, the septo-hippocampal projection needs to be reconsidered as a three neurotransmitter pathway. Synapse 58:151–164, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Moreover, via septo-hippocampal projections onto alveus/oriens interneurons, this circuit regulates feedforward inhibition of Schaffer collateral and perforant path input to CA1 pyramidal neurons in a locomotion-dependent manner.

Computational modeling studies have suggested that cellular properties such as spike frequency adaptation and persistent firing might underlie the grid cell firing. Recent in vivo studies also suggest that cholinergic activation influences grid cell firing. Here we investigated the anatomical distribution of firing frequency adaptation, the medium spike after hyperpolarization potential (mAHP), subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, sag potential, input resistance and persistent firing, in MEC layer II principal cells using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings in rats. Anatomical distributions of these properties were compared along both the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes, both with and without the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol. We found that spike frequency adaptation is significantly stronger in ventral than in dorsal neurons both with and without carbachol. Spike frequency adaptation was significantly correlated with the duration of the mAHP, which also showed a gradient along the dorso-ventral axis. In carbachol, we found that about 50\% of MEC layer II neurons show persistent firing which lasted more than 30 seconds. Persistent firing of MEC layer II neurons might contribute to grid cell firing by providing the excitatory drive. Dorso-ventral differences in spike frequency adaptation we report here are opposite from previous predictions by a computational model. We discuss an alternative mechanism as to how dorso-ventral differences in spike frequency adaptation could contribute to different scales of grid spacing.},

	abstract = {The recall of information stored in the hippocampus involves a series of corticocortical backprojections via the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and one or more neocortical stages. Each stage is considered to be a pattern association network, with the retrieval cue at each stage the firing of neurons in the previous stage. The leading factor that determines the capacity of this multistage pattern association backprojection pathway is the number of connections onto any one neuron, which provides a quantitative basis for why there are as many backprojections between adjacent stages in the hierarchy as forward projections. The issue arises of why this multistage backprojection system uses diluted connectivity. One reason is that a multistage backprojection system with expansion of neuron numbers at each stage enables the hippocampus to address during recall the very large numbers of neocortical neurons, which would otherwise require hippocampal neurons to make very large numbers of synapses if they were directly onto neocortical neurons. The second reason is that as shown here, diluted connectivity in the backprojection pathways reduces the probability of more than one connection onto a receiving neuron in the backprojecting pathways, which otherwise reduces the capacity of the system, that is the number of memories that can be recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. For similar reasons, diluted connectivity is advantageous in pattern association networks in other brain systems such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala; for related reasons, in autoassociation networks in, for example, the hippocampal CA3 and the neocortex; and for the different reason that diluted connectivity facilitates the operation of competitive networks in forward-connected cortical systems.},

The distribution of interneurons in presubicular lamina for each animal line was compared to that in the GAD67-GFP knock-in animal line. Labeling was specific in the Pvalb-Cre line with 87\% of labeled interneurons immunopositive for parvalbumin (PV). Immunostaining for somatostatin (SOM) revealed good specificity in the X98 line with 89\% of fluorescent cells, but a lesser specificity in Sst-Cre animals where only 71\% of labeled cells were immunopositive. A minority of \&\#x223C;6\% of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre, and X98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance.},

This information represents an important component of episodic memory, mediated by the parahippocampal-hippocampal region. A comprehensive description of insular projections to the latter region is lacking. Previous studies reported that insular projections do not target any of the subdivisions in the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyus, the cornu ammonis [CA] fields 1, 2, and 3 and the subiculum), but, in contrast, target the parahippocampal region (perirhinal, postrhinal, lateral and medial entorhinal cortices, and pre- and parasubiculum). The present study examined the topographical and laminar organization of insular projections to the parahippocampal region in the rat with the use of anterograde tracing. Notably, our results corroborated the absence of hippocampal projections. We further showed that the perirhinal and the lateral entorhinal cortices received extensive projections from the insular cortex, primarily from its agranular areas. With the exception of a weak projection to the postrhinal cortex, projections to the remaining parahippocampal areas were either absent or very sparse. The projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex displayed a preference for the deep layers of its most lateral subdivisions, known also to receive hippocampal inputs. Projections to the perirhinal cortex primarily targeted the superficial layers with a preference for its ventral subdivision, referred to as area 35. Our findings indicate that only processed information, reflecting emotional and affective states, but not primary gustatory and viscerosensory information, has direct access to the parahippocampal-hippocampal system.

In this study, we show that stimulation of cholinergic MSDB neurons in urethane-anesthetized mice acts on hippocampal networks via two distinct pathways. A direct septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection causes increased firing of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons with concomitantly decreased firing of principal cells. In addition, cholinergic neurons recruit noncholinergic neurons within the MSDB. This indirect pathway is required for hippocampal theta synchronization.

	abstract = {It is widely believed that the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is caused by the rhythmic input from the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MSDB). The main MSDB output is formed by GABAergic projection neurons which are divided into two subpopulations and fire at different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The MSDB also contains projection cholinergic, glutamatergic, and non-projection GABAergic neurons. These cell populations innervate each other and also GABAergic projection neurons and participate in the formation of the synchronous rhythmic output to the hippocampus. The purpose of this study is to work out a model of interactions between all neural populations of the MSDB that underlie the formation of the synchronous septal theta signal. The model is built from biologically plausible neurons of the Hodgkin-Huxley type and its architecture reflects modern data on the morphology of neural connections in the MSDB. The model satisfies the following requirements: (1) a large portion of neurons is fast-spiking; (2) the subpopulations of GABAergic projection neurons contain endogenous pacemaker neurons; (3) the phase shift of activity between subpopulations of GABAergic projection neurons is equal to about 150\&\#xB0;; and (4) the strengths of bidirectional connections between the subpopulations of GABAergic projection cells are different. It is shown that the theta rhythm generation can be performed by a system of glutamatergic and GABAergic non-projection neurons. We also show that bursting pacemaker neurons in the subpopulation of projection GABAergic neurons play a significant role in the formation of stable antiphase outputs from the MSDB to the hippocampus.},

In large-scale population recordings, the orthogonal nature of hippocampal representations across environments is evident in the complete reorganization of the firing locations of hippocampal place cells. Entorhinal grid cells provide inputs to the hippocampus, and their firing patterns shift relative to each other across different environments. Although this suggests that altered grid cell firing could generate distinct hippocampal population codes, it has recently been shown that new and distinct hippocampal place fields emerge while grid cell firing is compromised. We therefore propose that separate circuits within the medial entorhinal cortex are specialized for performing either spatial or memory-related computations.},

The proportion of grid cells in pre- and parasubiculum was comparable to deep layers of MEC. The symmetry of the grid pattern and its relationship to the theta rhythm were weaker, especially in presubiculum. Pre- and parasubicular grid cells intermingled with head-direction cells and border cells, as in deep MEC layers.

Basic properties of this map are present when rat pups explore the world outside of their nest for the first time, around postnatal day 16-18 (P16-P18). One of the first functions to be expressed in navigating animals is the directional tuning of the head direction cells. To determine whether head direction tuning is expressed at even earlier ages, before the start of exploration, and to establish whether vision is necessary for the development of directional tuning, we recorded neural activity in pre- and parasubiculum, or medial entorhinal cortex, from P11 onward, 3-4 days before the eyelids unseal. Head direction cells were present from the first day of recording. Firing rates were lower than in adults, and preferred firing directions were less stable, drifting within trials and changing completely between trials. Yet the cells drifted coherently, i.e., relative firing directions were maintained from one trial to the next. Directional tuning stabilized shortly after eye opening. The data point to a hardwired attractor network for representation of head direction in which directional tuning develops before vision and visual input serves primarily to anchor firing direction to the external world.},

We investigated changes in the expression of 10 major GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in subfields of the ventral hippocampus, ventral subiculum, EC, and perirhinal cortex (PRC) at different intervals (1, 8, 30, and 90 days) after kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus priming epileptogenesis in the rat. The most pronounced and ubiquitous changes were a transient (24 h after KA only) down-regulation of \&\#x3B3;2 mRNA and lasting decreases in subunit \&\#x3B1;5, \&\#x3B2;3, and \&\#x3B4; mRNAs that were prominent in all hippocampal and parahippocampal areas. In the subiculum similarly as in sectors CA1 and CA3, levels of subunit \&\#x3B1;1, \&\#x3B1;2, \&\#x3B1;4, and \&\#x3B3;2 mRNAs decreased transiently (1 day after KA-induced status epilepticus). They were followed by increased expression of subunit \&\#x3B1;1 and \&\#x3B1;3 mRNAs in the dentate gyrus (DG) and sectors CA1 and CA3, and subunit \&\#x3B1;1 also in the EC layer II (30 and 90 days after KA). We also observed sustained overexpression of subunits \&\#x3B1;4 and \&\#x3B3;2 in the subiculum and in the Ammon's horn. Subunit \&\#x3B3;2 mRNA was also increased in sector CA1 at the late intervals after KA. Taken together, our results suggest distinct regulation of mRNA expression for individual GABAA receptor subunits. Especially striking was the wide-spread down-regulation of the often peri- or extrasynaptically located subunits \&\#x3B1;5 and \&\#x3B4;. These subunits are often associated with tonic inhibition. Their decrease could be related to decreased tonic inhibition or may merely reflect compensatory changes. In contrast, expression of subunit \&\#x3B1;4 that may also mediate tonic inhibition when associated with the \&\#x3B4;-subunit was significantly upregulated in the DG and in the proximal subiculum at late intervals. Thus, concomitant up-regulation of subunit \&\#x3B3;2, \&\#x3B1;1 and \&\#x3B1;4 mRNAs (and loss in \&\#x3B4;-subunits) ultimately indicates significant rearrangement of GABAA receptor composition after KA-induced seizures.},

The distribution of subicular projections was studied in detail by means of the sensitive anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), and the precise origin of these projections analysed with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers, using double- and triple-labelling protocols. Injections of PHA-L in the proximal part of the dorsal subiculum, i.e. that part which borders field CA1, result in labelling of the infralimbic, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, the nucleus accumbens and the lateral septal region, the interanteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, the core of the nucleus gelatinosus, and the mammillary nuclei, in particular in the rostral parts of the medial nucleus. In contrast, injections in the distal part of the dorsal subiculum, i.e. that part which borders the presubiculum, give rise to labelling in the retrosplenial and postrhinal cortices, the presubiculum, the anterior thalamic complex, the shell of the nucleus gelatinosus, and the mammillary nuclei, preferentially in the caudal part of the medial nucleus. The results of injections of different retrograde tracers, simultaneously placed in two or three targets of the subicular efferents, confirm the results of the anterograde tracing experiments. Moreover, they clearly demonstrate that the population of subicular neurons which, for example, projects to the nucleus accumbens and the interanteromedial nucleus of the thalamus is almost completely segregated from the population that projects to the retrosplenial cortex and the anterior complex of the thalamus. Thus within the dorsal subiculum, populations of neurons can be differentiated so that each population projects to a unique set of target structures. These cell populations are differentially positioned along the proximo-distal axis. In view of additional evidence indicating that some of the major afferents to the subiculum are organized along the same axis, we suggest that the heterogeneity of the dorsal subiculum along the proximo-distal axis reflects a general organizational characteristic of this hippocampal field.},

The aim of this study was to characterize and compare the efferent and afferent connections of perirhinal areas 35 and 36, postrhinal cortex, and the lateral and medial entorhinal areas (LEA and MEA) with dorsal and ventral components of the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, hippocampus cornu ammonis fields, and subiculum) as well as the presubiculum, and the parasubiculum. The entorhinal connections were also characterized with respect to the LEA and MEA dentate gyrus-projecting bands. In general, the entorhinal connections with the hippocampal formation are much stronger than the perirhinal and postrhinal connections. The entorhinal cortex projects strongly to all components of the hippocampal formation, whereas the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices project weakly and only to CA1 and the subiculum. In addition, the postrhinal cortex preferentially targets the dorsal CA1 and subiculum, whereas the perirhinal cortex targets ventral subiculum. Similarly, the perirhinal cortex receives more input from ventral hippocampal formation structures and the postrhinal cortex receives more input from dorsal hippocampal structures. The LEA and the MEA medial band are more strongly interconnected with ventral hippocampal structures, whereas the MEA lateral band is more interconnected with dorsal hippocampal structures. With regard to the presubiculum and parasubiculum, the postrhinal cortex and the MEA lateral band receive stronger input from the dorsal presubiculum and caudal parasubiculum. In contrast, the LEA and MEA medial bands receive stronger input from the ventral presubiculum and rostral parasubiculum.},

The PaS also receives heavy cholinergic innervation from the medial septum, which contributes to the generation of theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Cholinergic receptor activation exerts a wide range of effects in other areas of the hippocampal formation, including membrane depolarization, changes in neuronal excitability, and suppression of excitatory synaptic responses. The present study was aimed at determining how cholinergic receptor activation modulates excitatory synaptic input to the layer II/III neurons of the PaS in acute brain slices. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layer II/III of the PaS were evoked by stimulation of either layer I afferents, or ascending inputs from layer V. Bath-application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (0.5-10 \&\#x3BC;M) suppressed the amplitude of fEPSPs evoked by both superficial- and deep layer stimulation, and also enhanced paired-pulse facilitation. Constant bath-application of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline (10 \&\#x3BC;M) failed to eliminate the suppression, indicating that the cholinergic suppression of fEPSPs is not due to increased inhibitory tone. The muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 \&\#x3BC;M) blocked the suppression of fEPSPs, and the selective M(1)-preferring receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 \&\#x3BC;M), but not the M(2)-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1-5 \&\#x3BC;M), also significantly attenuated the suppression. Therefore, cholinergic receptor activation suppresses excitatory synaptic input to layer II/III neurons of the PaS, and this suppression is mediated in part by M(1) receptor activation.},

The PaS receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer II PaS neurons. Bath application of carbachol (CCh; 10-50 \&\#xB5;M) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer II stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 \&\#xB5;M), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 \&\#xB5;M), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that CCh resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist XE-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K(+) current I M. The remaining inward current also reversed near EK and was inhibited by the K(+) channel blocker Ba(2+), suggesting that M1 receptor activation attenuates both I M as well as an additional K(+) current. The additional K(+) current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K(+) conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer II PaS neurons therefore appears to occur through M1-mediated effects on I M as well as an additional K(+) conductance.},

Directional information likely originates in the head direction-vestibular system and PrS and PaS are thought to provide this information to MEC. Efferents from PaS and PrS show a selective laminar terminal distribution in MEC superficial layers II and III, respectively. We hypothesized that this anatomically determined laminar distribution does not preclude monosynaptic interaction with neurons located in deeper layers of MEC in view of the extensive apical dendrites from deeper cells reaching layers II and III. This hypothesis was tested in the rat using tilted in vitro slices in which origins and terminations of PrS and PaS fibers were maintained, as assessed using anterograde anatomical tracing. Based on voltage-sensitive dye imaging, multipatch single-cell recordings, and scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate, we report first that principal neurons in all layers of MEC receive convergent monosynaptic inputs from PrS and PaS and second, that elicited responses show layer-specific decay times and frequency-dependent facilitation. These results indicate that regardless of their selective laminar terminal distribution, PrS and PaS inputs may monosynaptically convey directional information to principal neurons in all layers of MEC through synapses on their extensive dendritic arbors.},

In the literature, the ProS (in primate) and PoS (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub.},

This projection shows a striking topographic organization along its three-dimensional axes. Here we aimed to study the development of this projection system. We found that an adult-like topography of subiculum-to-parahippocampal projections is present by postnatal day 7 (P7). The cellular morphology in the subiculum is immature at this age, reaching maturity by P15-19. The density of projections increases from P7 to P15-19 but does so within the constraints of the adult topography. Projections to the entorhinal cortex show a clear arrangement in line with the adult data, in that distal portions of the subiculum project to the medial entorhinal cortex, whereas proximal portions project to the lateral entorhinal cortex. Our results add new details to the proximodistal organization of projections to the pre- and parasubiculum. We show that these projections arise exclusively from the more distal part, sharing their origin with that of medial entorhinal projections. Within this distal portion of the subiculum, a proximodistal gradient of origin maps onto a presubicular termination gradient starting in proximal presubiculum and extending gradually until it covers the proximodistal extent. Proximally located neurons in the distal part of the subiculum target the distal portion of the parasubiculum, and distal subicular neurons target the proximal most portion of parasubiculum. Given the specificity of the known topographic projections this early in development, we expect that these newly described topographic features will be maintained in the adult.},

For this analysis, the full network was decomposed along the three anatomical axes, resulting in three networks that describe the connectivity within the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral and laminar dimensions. The rostrocaudal network had a connection density of 12\&\#xA0;\% and a path length of 2.4. The dorsoventral network had a high cluster coefficient (0.53), a relatively high path length (1.62) and a rich club was identified. The modularity analysis revealed three modules in the dorsoventral network. The laminar network contained most information. The laminar dimension revealed a network with high clustering coefficient (0.47), a relatively high path length (2.11) and four significantly increased characteristic network building blocks (structural motifs). Thirteen rich club nodes were identified, almost all of them situated in the parahippocampal region. Six connector hubs were detected and all of them were located in the entorhinal cortex. Three large modules were revealed, indicating a close relationship between the perirhinal and postrhinal cortex as well as between the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex. These results confirmed the central position of the entorhinal cortex in the (para)hippocampal network and this possibly explains why pathology in this region has such profound impact on cognitive function, as seen in several brain diseases. The results also have implications for the idea of strict separation of the "spatial" and the "non-spatial" information stream into the hippocampus. This two-stream memory model suggests that the information influx from, respectively, the postrhinal-medial entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal-lateral entorhinal cortex is separate, but the current analysis shows that this apparent separation is not determined by anatomical constraints.},

	abstract = {In vivo two-photon microscopy provides the foundation for an array of powerful techniques for optically measuring and perturbing neural circuits. However, challenging tissue properties and geometry have prevented high-resolution optical access to regions situated within deep fissures. These regions include the medial prefrontal and medial entorhinal cortex (mPFC and MEC), which are of broad scientific and clinical interest. Here, we present a method for in vivo, subcellular resolution optical access to the mPFC and MEC using microprisms inserted into the fissures. We chronically imaged the mPFC and MEC in mice running on a spherical treadmill, using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and genetically encoded calcium indicators to measure network activity. In the MEC, we imaged grid cells, a widely studied cell type essential to memory and spatial information processing. These cells exhibited spatially modulated activity during navigation in a virtual reality environment. This method should be extendable to other brain regions situated within deep fissures, and opens up these regions for study at cellular resolution in behaving animals using a rapidly expanding palette of optical tools for perturbing and measuring network structure and function.},

Layer 2 stellate cells resided in hundreds of small patches. At the dorsomedial entorhinal border, we identified larger (putative parasubicular) patches, which contained polarized head-direction selective neurons firing during the descending theta phase.

These nested gamma oscillations closely resemble activity during spatial exploration, are generated by local feedback inhibition without recurrent excitation, and have clock-like features suitable as reference signals for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded grid firing fields. In network models deduced from our data, feedback inhibition supports coexistence of theta-nested gamma oscillations with attractor states that generate grid firing fields.

CA1 interneurons are a diverse group consisting of many subtypes, some of which provide compartment-specific inhibition specifically onto pyramidal neuron dendrites. In fact, the majority of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons is found on their dendrites. The specific role of a dendrite-innervating interneuron subtype is primarily determined by its innervation pattern on the distinct dendritic domains of pyramidal neurons. The efficacy of dendritic inhibition in reducing dendritic excitation depends on the relative timing and location of the activated excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In vivo, synaptic properties such as short-term plasticity and neuro-modulation by the basal forebrain, govern the degree of inhibition in distinct dendritic domains in a dynamic, behavior dependent manner, specifically during network oscillation such as the theta rhythm. In this review we focus on two subtypes of dendrite-innervating interneurons: the oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneuron and the bistratified interneuron. Their molecular marker profile, morphology, and function in vivo and in vitro are well studied. We strive to integrate this diverse information from the cellular to the network level, and to provide insight into how the different characteristics of O-LM and bistratified interneurons affect dendritic excitability, network activity, and behavior.},

Following activation of MS axons, we observed fast monosynaptic GABAergic IPSPs in the majority (\&gt;60\%) of fast-spiking (FS) and low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in all layers of the MEC, but in only 1.5\% of nonstellate principal cells (NSPCs) and in no stellate cells. We also observed fast glutamatergic responses to MS activation in a minority (\&lt;5\%) of NSPCs, FS, and LTS interneurons. During stimulation of MS inputs at theta frequency (10 Hz), the amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs was maintained, and spike output from LTS and FS interneurons was entrained at low (25-60 Hz) and high (60-180 Hz) gamma frequencies, respectively. By demonstrating cell type-specific targeting of the GABAergic projection from the MS to the MEC, our results support the idea that the MS controls theta frequency activity in the MEC through coordination of inhibitory circuits.},

	abstract = {The factors that control the spatial tuning of hippocampal neurons are incompletely understood, and there is no generally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a “place field”. One factor that must be considered is the phenomenon of “phase precession”. As a rat passes through the place field of a particular hippocampal neuron, its spikes shift to earlier phases of the theta rhythm. Except for the special cases discussed herein, the phase shift never exceeds 360°. Moreover, under conditions in which place field sizes change dynamically, precession rate is tightly coupled with the place field size, suggesting that a single cycle of theta phase precession could be used to define unitary place field boundaries. Theta phase precession implies that the “cell assembly” of active hippocampal neurons changes systematically over the course of a single theta cycle. A given cell can exhibit more than one place field in a given environment, each field showing the same pattern of 360° of phase precession. The existence of multiple fields implies that one cell can participate in multiple cell assemblies within the same environment. We show here that place fields, defined as a single cycle of phase precession, can overlap spatially, with the result that the cell fires with spikes clustered at two different phases over the theta cycles in which the fields overlap. Thus, the same neuron can participate in different cell assemblies within a single theta cycle. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The theta rhythm is the largest extracellular synchronous signal that can be recorded from the mammalian brain, and has been strongly implicated in mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. We advance the proposal that the theta rhythm represents a "tag" for short-term memory processing in the hippocampus. We propose that the hippocampus receives two main types of input, theta from ascending brainstem-diencephalo-septal systems and "information bearing" mainly from thalamocortical and cortical systems. The temporal convergence of activity of these two systems results in the encoding of information in the hippocampus, primarily reaching it via cortical routes. By analogy to processes associated with long-term potentiation (LTP), we suggest that theta represents a strong depolarizing influence on NMDA receptor-containing cells of the hippocampus. The temporal coupling of a theta-induced depolarization and the release of glutamate to these cells from intra- and extrahippocampal sources activates them. This, in turn, initiates processes leading to a (short-term) strengthening of connections between presynaptic ("information bearing") and postsynaptic neurons of the hippocampus. Theta is selectively present in the rat during active exploratory movements. During exploration, a rat continually gathers and updates information about its environment. If this information is temporally coupled to theta (as with the case of locomotion), it becomes temporarily stored in the hippocampus by mechanisms similar to the early phase of LTP (E-LTP). If the exploratory behavior of the rat goes unreinforced, these relatively short-lasting traces (1-3 h) gradually weaken and eventually fade-to be reupdated. On the other hand, if the explorations of the rat lead to rewards (or punishments), additional modulatory inputs to the hippocampus become activated and convert the short-term, theta-dependent memory, into long-term stores.},

During the game, the patients alternated between searching for passengers, whose locations were random, and delivering them to stores, whose locations remained constant.

The second objective of our studies was to verify our earlier in vitro findings and to demonstrate, for the first time, gating cells in intact hippocampus during the generation of Type II theta in urethane anaesthetized rats. Two hundred ninety-nine theta-related cells were isolated and recorded from in vivo and in vitro hippocampal formation. Twenty out of all 299 neurons (6.6\%) were classified as gating cells. The neuron was classified as a gating cell if it met one of the following criteria: (i) the cell discharges occurred precisely in the beginning and at the end of each theta epoch (gating cell A); (ii) the cell began to discharge just before the transition from non-theta interval/LIA into the theta epoch (gating cell B); (iii) the cell began to discharge just after the transition from the theta epoch into non-theta interval/LIA (gating cell C). Our data demonstrates that the appearance of theta epochs and their length, as well as the appearance of non-theta states (in vivo recorded LIA or in vitro recorded intervals between theta epochs) and their length, may require the existence of a specific population of hippocampal neurons which we termed gating cells.},

Since these areas are reciprocally interconnected with the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, it would aid our understanding of limbic function to elucidate the location and neurochemical content of the entorhino-septal and septo-supramammillary projection neurons, as well as that of their postsynaptic targets. Light and electron microscopic immunostaining for calretinin, in combination with antero- and retrograde tracer techniques, postembedding immunostaining for GABA and the transmitter specific [3H]D-aspartate retrograde radiolabeling, as well as a co-localization experiment for calretinin and glutamate decarboxylase in rat supramammillary and septal neurons, demonstrated that: (i) a large population of entorhinal cells that forms asymmetric synaptic contacts on calretinin-containing neurons located at the border between the medial and lateral septal areas contains calretinin and are aspartate/glutamatergic; (ii) the overwhelming majority of calretinin-immunoreactive cells located at the border between the lateral and medial septal area are GABAergic; (iii) these neurons can be retrogradely labeled from the supramammillary area; (iv) anterogradely labeled axons originating in the border between the medial and lateral septum are GABAergic and (v) terminate on supramammillary area non-GABAergic, calretinin-containing neurons, which are known to project to the septal complex and hippocampus.

This reversed signaling involved GABAergic mechanisms. However, when hippocampal circuits were physically limited to a lamellar slab, CA3 outputs synchronized CA1 and the subiculum using excitatory mechanisms, as predicted by classic hippocampal models. Finally, analysis of in vivo recordings revealed that this reversed theta flow was most prominent during REM sleep.

In contrast, previous studies of rhythmic hippocampal activity in primates under comparable behavioral conditions suggest it may be less apparent and possibly less prevalent, or even absent, compared with the rodent. We compared the relative presence of low-frequency oscillations in rats and humans during spatial navigation by using an oscillation detection algorithm ("P-episode" or "BOSC") to better characterize their presence in microelectrode local field potential (LFP) recordings. This method quantifies the proportion of time the LFP exceeds both a power and cycle duration threshold at each frequency, characterizing the presence of (1) oscillatory activity compared with background noise, (2) the peak frequency of oscillatory activity, and (3) the duration of oscillatory activity. Results demonstrate that both humans and rodents have hippocampal rhythmic fluctuations lasting, on average, 2.75 and 4.3 cycles, respectively. Analyses further suggest that human hippocampal rhythmicity is centered around \&\#x223C;3 Hz while that of rats is centered around \&\#x223C;8 Hz. These results establish that low-frequency rhythms relevant to spatial navigation are present in both the rodent and human hippocampus, albeit with different properties under the behavioral conditions tested.},

	abstract = {The theta oscillation is a neuroscience enigma. When a rat runs through an environment, large-amplitude theta oscillations (4-10 Hz) reliably appear in the hippocampus's electrical activity. The consistency of this pattern led to theta playing a central role in theories on the neural basis of mammalian spatial navigation and memory. However, in fact, hippocampal oscillations at 4-10 Hz are rare in humans and in some other species. This presents a challenge for theories proposing theta as an essential component of the mammalian brain, including models of place and grid cells. Here, I examine this issue by reviewing recent research on human hippocampal oscillations using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients. This work indicates that the human hippocampus does indeed exhibit rhythms that are functionally similar to theta oscillations found in rodents, but that these signals have a slower frequency of approximately 1-4 Hz. I argue that oscillatory models of navigation and memory derived from rodent data are relevant for humans, but that they should be modified to account for the slower frequency of the human theta rhythm.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus expresses a variety of highly organized network states which bind its individual neurons into collective modes of activity. These patterns go along with characteristic oscillations of extracellular potential known as theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations. Such network oscillations share some important features throughout the entire central nervous system of higher animals: they are restricted to a defined behavioral state, they are mostly generated by subthreshold synaptic activity, and they entrain active neurons to fire action potentials at strictly defined phases of the oscillation cycle, thereby providing a unifying 'zeitgeber' for coordinated multineuronal activity. Recent work from the hippocampus of rodents and humans has revealed how the resulting spatiotemporal patterns support the formation of neuronal assemblies which, in our present understanding, form the neuronal correlate of spatial, declarative, or episodic memories. In this review, we introduce the major types of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the hippocampus, describe the underlying neuronal mechanisms, and illustrate the concept of memory formation within oscillating networks. Research on hippocampus-dependent memory has become a key model system at the interface between cellular and cognitive neurosciences. The next step will be to translate our increasing insight into the mechanisms and systemic functions of neuronal networks into urgently needed new therapeutic strategies.},

Oscillatory evoked potentials of 20-50 Hz and spontaneous fast (gamma) waves were more prominent during theta compared with non-theta behaviors. The oscillations were simulated by a systems model with recurrent inhibition. The model also predicts a behaviorally dependent inhibition, which was confirmed experimentally using paired-pulse responses. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the population spikes in CA1 was larger during walking than immobility, mostly mediated by a cholinergic input. Spike responses in vitro were characterized by a relative lack of inhibition or disinhibition compared with the behaving rat. The two-input, two-dipole model of the theta rhythm in CA1 is reviewed. Afferents to the CA1 pyramidal cells are assumed to be rhythmic and consist of atropine-sensitive and atropine-resistant inputs driving the somata and distal dendrites, respectively. The atropine-sensitive theta rhythm was mainly caused by a series of Cl- mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) on pyramidal cells. It is suggested that previous claims of the participation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and not IPSPs in the intracellular recordings in vivo were flawed. Single cell recordings in vitro suggested that intrinsic voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations modulate the response to a theta-frequency driving. Membrane potentials of pyramidal cells in vitro showed resonance in the theta frequency range.},

Most cells inhibited during SPW (80\%) fired rhythmically and phase-locked to the negative peak of the CA1 pyramidal layer theta waves. Because both SPW and the negative peak of local theta waves correspond to the maximum discharge probability of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneuron classes, the findings indicate that the activity of medial septal neurons can be negatively (during SPW) or positively (during theta waves) correlated with the activity of hippocampal interneurons.

	abstract = {1. The electroresponsive properties of neurons from layer II of the rat medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) were studied by intracellular recording under current clamp in an in vitro brain slice preparation. From a total of 184 cells that fulfilled our criteria for recording stability, two groups of projection neurons were distinguished on the basis of their intrinsic biophysical properties and morphological characteristics (demonstrated by intracellular biocytin injection; n = 34). 2. Stellate cells (SCs) were the most abundant (69\%). They were highly electroresponsive, and minimal changes (1-3 mV) of membrane potential generated an active response. Subthreshold depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulse injection always caused the membrane potential to attain an early peak and then sag to a lower level. Depolarization-induced "sags" were larger and determined early firing in all cells. The voltage-current relationship of SCs was markedly non-linear, demonstrating robust inward rectification in the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing range. 3. SCs generated persistent rhythmic subthreshold voltage oscillations on DC depolarization positive to -60 mV. The mean frequency of the oscillations was 8.6 Hz (theta range) at a membrane potential of approximately -55 mV, at which level occasional single spiking also occurred. At slightly more positive potentials, a striking 1- to 3-Hz repetitive bursting pattern emerged. This consisted of nonadapting trains of spikes ("clusters") interspersed with subthreshold oscillations that had a mean frequency of 21.7 Hz (beta range). 4. Nonstellate cells (39\%; mostly pyramidal-like) displayed time-dependent inward rectification that was less pronounced than that of SCs, and minimal depolarization-induced sags. On threshold depolarization, firing was always preceded by a slowly rising ramp depolarization and thus occurred with a long delay. Inward rectification in the depolarizing range was very pronounced. However, non-SCs did not generate persistent rhythmic subthreshold oscillatory activity or spike clusters. 5. Of the electrophysiological parameters quantified, spike threshold, spike duration, depolarizing afterpotential amplitude and apparent membrane time constant demonstrated statistically significant differences between SCs and non-SCs. 6. The repetitive hiring properties in response to square current pulses of short duration (\&lt; 500 ms) were also different between SCs and non-SCs. First, most SCs displayed a bilinear frequency-current (f-I) relationship for only the first interspike interval, whereas most non-SCs displayed a bilinear relationship for all intervals. Second, SCs had a much steeper primary f-I slope for early intervals than non-SCs. Finally, SCs displayed more pronounced and faster spike frequency adaptation than non-SCs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of epilepsy in adults, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. Layer II stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex, which are hyperexcitable in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, provide the predominant synaptic input to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Previous studies have ascribed the hyperexcitability of layer II stellate cells to GABAergic interneurons becoming "dormant" after disconnection from their excitatory synaptic inputs, which has been reported to occur during preferential loss of layer III pyramidal cells. We used whole-cell recording from slices of entorhinal cortex in pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats to test the dormant interneuron hypothesis. Hyperexcitability appeared as multiple action potentials and prolonged depolarizations evoked in layer II stellate cells of epileptic rats but not controls. However, blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission caused similar percentage reductions in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in layer II stellate cells of control and epileptic rats, suggesting similar levels of excitatory synaptic input to GABAergic interneurons. Direct recordings and biocytin labeling revealed two major types of interneurons in layer III whose excitatory synaptic drive in epileptic animals was undiminished. Interneurons in layer III did not appear to be dormant; therefore, we tested whether loss of GABAergic synapses might underlie hyperexcitability of layer II stellate cells. Stereological evidence of fewer GABAergic interneurons, fewer gephyrin-immunoreactive punctae, and reduced frequency of spontaneous IPSCs and miniature IPSCs (recorded in tetrodotoxin) confirmed that layer II stellate cell hyperexcitability is attributable, at least in part, to reduced inhibitory synaptic input.},

	abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is an increasingly important focus for investigation of mechanisms for spatial representation. Grid cells found in layer II of the MEC are likely to be stellate cells, which form a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties, but how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet clear. Here, we review the ionic conductances, synaptic, and excitable properties of stellate cells, and examine their implications for models of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate periodic oscillations. An alternative possibility is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence that the dorsal-ventral organization of synaptic integration by stellate cells, through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels, influences the corresponding organization of grid fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields, we introduce new data comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings. We find that clustered patterns of action potential firing and the action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP) are particularly sensitive to recording condition. Nevertheless, with both methods, these properties, resting membrane properties and resonance follow a dorsal-ventral organization. Further investigation of the molecular basis for synaptic integration by stellate cells will be important for understanding mechanisms for generation of grid fields.},

Many in vitro oscillations are gated by synaptic inhibition but are influenced by electrical coupling as well; one type depends solely on electrical coupling. For some oscillations dependent upon inhibition, the detailed firing patterns of interneurons can influence long-range synchronization. Two sorts of electrical coupling are important in modulating or generating various in vitro oscillations: (a) between interneurons, primarily between dendrites; and (b) between axons of pyramidal neurons. VFO can exist in isolation or can act as generators of gamma frequency oscillations.

This review focuses on intrinsic cellular properties of neurons in EC that may underlie functions such as working memory, spatial processing, and episodic memory. In particular, the study of stellate cells (SCs) in medial entorhinal has resulted in discovery of correlations between physiological properties of these neurons and properties of the unique spatial representation that is demonstrated through unit recordings of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) from awake-behaving animals. A separate line of investigation has demonstrated persistent firing behavior among neurons in EC that is enhanced by cholinergic activity and could underlie working memory. There is also evidence that acetylcholine plays a role in modulation of synaptic transmission that could also enhance mnemonic function in EC. Finally, the local circuits of EC demonstrate a variety of interneuron physiology, which is also subject to cholinergic modulation. Together these effects alter the dynamics of EC to underlie the functional role of acetylcholine in memory.},

It has been suggested that visual inputs are fed to the navigational network in cortex and hippocampus through dorsal and ventral intracortical streams (Whitlock et al., 2008), but this has not been shown directly in rodents. We have used cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic markers, topographic mapping of receptive fields, and pathway tracing to determine in mouse visual cortex whether the lateromedial field (LM) and the anterolateral field (AL), which are the principal targets of primary visual cortex (V1) (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007) specialized for processing nonspatial and spatial visual information (Gao et al., 2006), are distinct areas with diverse connections. We have found that the LM/AL border coincides with a change in type 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression in layer 4 and with the representation of the lower visual field periphery. Our quantitative analyses also show that LM strongly projects to temporal cortex as well as the lateral entorhinal cortex, which has weak spatial selectivity (Hargreaves et al., 2005). In contrast, AL has stronger connections with posterior parietal cortex, motor cortex, and the spatially selective medial entorhinal cortex (Haftig et al., 2005). These results support the notion that LM and AL are architecturally, topographically, and connectionally distinct areas of extrastriate visual cortex and that they are gateways for ventral and dorsal streams.},

Oscillatory interference models of grid cells predict theta amplitude modulations of membrane potential during firing field traversals, whereas competing attractor network models predict slow depolarizing ramps. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we tested these models by directly measuring grid cell intracellular potentials in mice running along linear tracks in virtual reality. Grid cells had large and reproducible ramps of membrane potential depolarization that were the characteristic signature tightly correlated with firing fields. Grid cells also demonstrated intracellular theta oscillations that influenced their spike timing. However, the properties of theta amplitude modulations were not consistent with the view that they determine firing field locations. Our results support cellular and network mechanisms in which grid fields are produced by slow ramps, as in attractor models, whereas theta oscillations control spike timing.},

Using electrophysiological and morphological techniques within a slice preparation, we can classify medial entorhinal cortex layer III cells into four different types. Type 1 and 2 cells were projection cells. Type 1 cells fired regularly and possessed high input resistances and long membrane time constants. Electrical stimulation of the lateral entorhinal cortex revealed a strong excitation by both N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Type 2 cells accommodated strongly, had lower input resistances, faster time constants and featured prominent synaptic inhibition. Type 1 and 2 cells responded to repetitive synaptic stimulation with a prolonged hyperpolarization. We identified the two other, presumed local circuit, cell types whose axons remained within the entorhinal cortex. Type 3 cells were regular firing, had high input resistances and slow membrane time constants, while type 4 cells fired at higher frequencies and possessed a faster time constant and lower input resistance than type 3 neurons. Type 3 cells presented long-lasting excitatory synaptic potentials. Type 4 neurons were the only ones with different responses to stimulation from different sites. Upon lateral entorhinal cortex stimulation they responded with an excitatory postsynaptic potential, while a monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potential was evoked from deep layer stimulation. In contrast to type 1 and 2 neurons, none of the local circuit cells could be antidromically activated from deep layers, and prolonged hyperpolarizations following synaptic repetitive stimulation were also absent in these cells. Together, the complementing morphology and the electrophysiological characteristics of all the cells can provide the controlled flexibility required during the transfer of cortical information to the hippocampus.},

Using design-based stereological methods, we estimated the numbers, proportions, densities and sectional areas of layer II cells in the medial entorhinal area (MEA), and its constituent caudal entorhinal (CE) and medial entorhinal (ME) fields, in the rat and mouse. We estimated layer II of the MEA to contain approximately 58,000 neurons in the rat and approximately 24,000 neurons in the mouse. Field CE accounted for more than three-quarters of the total neuron population in both species. In the rat, layer II of the MEA is comprised of 38\% ovoid stellate cells, 29\% polygonal stellate cells and 17\% pyramidal cells. The remainder is comprised of much smaller populations of horizontal bipolar, tripolar, oblique pyramidal and small round cells. In the mouse, MEA layer II is comprised of 52\% ovoid stellate cells, 22\% polygonal stellate cells and 14\% pyramidal cells. Significant species differences in the proportions of ovoid and polygonal stellate cells suggest differences in physiological and functional properties. The majority of MEA layer II cells contribute to the entorhinal-hippocampal pathways. The degree of divergence from MEA layer II cells to the dentate granule cells was similar in the rat and mouse. In both rat and mouse, the only dorsoventral difference we observed is a gradient in polygonal stellate cell sectional area, which may relate to the dorsoventral increase in the size and spacing of individual neuronal firing fields. In summary, we found species-specific cellular compositions of MEA layer II, while, within a species, quantitative parameters other than cell size are stable along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axis of the MEA.},

The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal.

However, some features of place cell behavior, such as the sometimes independent responsiveness of place cells to environmental change (called "remapping"), seem hard to reconcile with attractor dynamics. This paper suggests that the explanation may be found in an anatomical separation of the two attractor systems coupled with a dynamic contextual modulation of the connection matrix between the two systems, with new learning being back-propagated into the matrix. Such a scheme could explain how place cells sometimes behave coherently and sometimes independently.},

Antigen PSD-95, also present in mouse and rat PSDs was virtually absent from cytoplasm, myelin, mitochondria, and microsomes from rodent or bovine brain. Antigens PSD-82 and PSD-72 were present in all subcellular fractions from bovine brain, especially in mitochondria, but were almost absent from rodent brain. The antiserum also contained low-affinity antibodies against tubulin. (b)Immunohistochemical studies were performed in mouse and rat brain, where antigen PSD-95 accounted for 90 percent of the antiserum binding after adsorption with purified brain tubulin. At the light microscope level, antibody binding was observed only in those regions of the brain where synapses are known to be present. No reaction was observed in myelinated tracts, in the neuronal cytoplasm, or in nonneuronal cells. Strong reactivity was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Experimental lesions, such as ablation of the rat entorhinal cortex or intraventricular injection of kainic acid, which led to a major loss of PSD in well- defined areas of the hippocampal formation, caused a correlative decrease in immunoreactivity in these areas. Abnormal patterns of immunohistochemical staining correlated with abnormal synaptic patterns in the cerebella of reeler and staggerer mouse mutants. (c) At the electron microscopic level, immunoreactivity was detectable only in PSD. The antibody did not bind to myelin, mitochondria or plasma membranes. (d) The results indicate that antigen PSD-95 is located predominantly or exclusively in PSD and can be used as a marker during subcellular fractionation. Other potential uses include the study of synaptogenesis, and the detection of changes in synapse number after experimental perturbations of the nervous system.},

Theta rhythm is the best synchronized electroencephalographic activity that can be recorded from the mammalian brain.

Although detailed studies of the physiology and pharmacology of theta-band oscillations have been carried out since the early 1950s, the first demonstration of atropine-sensitive theta rhythm, recorded in completely deafferented hippocampal slices of a rat, was performed in the second half of the 1980s. Since the discovery of cholinergically induced in vitro theta rhythm recorded from hippocampal formation slices, the central mechanisms underlying theta generation have been successfully studied in in vitro conditions. Most of these experiments were focused on the basic question regarding the similarities between the cholinergically induced theta activity and theta rhythm examined in vivo. The results of numerous in vitro experiments strongly suggest that cholinergically induced theta rhythm recorded in hippocampal slices is a useful analogue of theta observed in intact animals, and could be helpful in searching for the mechanisms of oscillations and synchrony in the central nervous system neuronal networks. The objective of the present review is to discuss the main results of experiments concerning theta oscillations recorded in in vitro conditions.
