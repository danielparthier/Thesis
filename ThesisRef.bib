  abstract = {The parasubiculum (PaS) is a component of the hippocampal formation that sends its major output to layer II of the entorhinal cortex. The PaS receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer II PaS neurons. Bath application of carbachol (CCh; 10\textendash{}50 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}M) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer II stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}M), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}M), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that CCh resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist XE-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K+ current IM. The remaining inward current also reversed near EK and was inhibited by the K+ channel blocker Ba2+, suggesting that M1 receptor activation attenuates both IM as well as an additional K+ current. The additional K+ current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K+ conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer II PaS neurons therefore appears to occur through M1-mediated effects on IM as well as an additional K+ conductance.},

  title = {Contribution of {{Ih}} to the Relative Facilitation of Synaptic Responses Induced by Carbachol in the Entorhinal Cortex during Repetitive Stimulation of the Parasubiculum},
  volume = {278},
  issn = {0306-4522},
  abstract = {Neurons in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex provide the hippocampus with the majority of its cortical sensory input, and also receive the major output projection from the parasubiculum. This puts the parasubiculum in a position to modulate the activity of entorhinal neurons that project to the hippocampus. These brain areas receive cholinergic projections that are active during periods of theta- and gamma-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate how cholinergic receptor activation affects the strength of repetitive synaptic responses at these frequencies in the parasubiculo-entorhinal pathway and the cellular mechanisms involved. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of rat layer II medial entorhinal neurons were conducted using an acute slice preparation, and responses to 5-pulse trains of stimulation at theta- and gamma-frequency delivered to the parasubiculum were recorded. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed the amplitude of single synaptic responses, but also produced a relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during stimulation trains. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker APV did not significantly reduce the relative facilitation effect. However, the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (Ih) channel blocker ZD7288 mimicked the relative facilitation induced by CCh, suggesting that CCh-induced inhibition of Ih could produce the effect by increasing dendritic input resistance (Rin). Inward-rectifying and leak K+ currents are known to interact with Ih to affect synaptic excitability. Application of the K+ channel antagonist Ba2+ depolarized neurons and enhanced temporal summation, but did not block further facilitation of train-evoked responses by ZD7288. The Ih-dependent facilitation of synaptic responses can therefore occur during reductions in inward-rectifying potassium current (IKir) associated with dendritic depolarization. Thus, in addition to cholinergic reductions in transmitter release that are known to facilitate train-evoked responses, these findings emphasize the role of inhibition of Ih in the integration of synaptic inputs within the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically-induced oscillatory states, likely due to enhanced summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced by increases in dendritic Rin.},

  abstract = {The parasubiculum is a major component of the hippocampal formation that receives inputs from the CA1 region, anterior thalamus, and medial septum and that projects primarily to layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Hippocampal theta-frequency (4\textendash{}12 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity has been correlated with sensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and memory functions. The present study was aimed at determining if theta is also generated locally within the parasubiculum versus volume conducted from adjacent structures. In urethan-anesthetized rats, the phase-reversal of theta activity between superficial and deep layers of the parasubiculum was demonstrated using differential recordings from movable bipolar electrodes that eliminate the influence of volume-conducted activity. Parasubicular theta was abolished by atropine, and was in phase with theta in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region. Whole cell current-clamp recordings in brain slices were then used to determine if parasubicular theta may be generated in part by membrane potential oscillations in layer II neurons. Membrane potential oscillations occurred in most layer II neurons, including four putative interneurons, when cells were held at near-threshold voltages using current injection. The frequency of oscillations increased from 3.2 to 6.1 Hz when bath temperature was raised from 22 to 32\textdegree{}C, and oscillations persisted in the presence of blockers of fast ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. Oscillations are therefore likely generated by intrinsic, voltage-dependent ionic conductances. These results indicate that theta field activity is generated locally within the parasubiculum and that intrinsic membrane potential oscillations, synchronized by local inhibitory inputs, may contribute to the generation of this activity.},

  abstract = {Grid cell spatial period is thought to be dictated by a mapping between the speed-direction modulated excitatory inputs, and consequent modulation of the firing rate, yet, the exact underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, through experiments on the medial entorhinal cortex stellate cells, subjected to in-vivo like stochastic synaptic activity through the dynamic clamp, we show that such mapping can emerge from a theta-frequency resonance in the signal gain, which is HCN sensitive, robust to noise, and is potent enough to modulate the synaptic responses in the theta frequency. This modulation also extends to the corresponding theta-gamma modulation of the firing rate, the slope of whose excitation mediated increase is steeper in the presence of HCN channels. We also show that in the cells devoid of HCN channels, inhibition can emulate their role. Considering the dorso-ventral gradients of HCN and inhibition, which are present aligned to the grid spacing gradient in the medial entorhinal cortex, these findings should be noteworthy.},

  issn = {1050-9631},
  abstract = {Distinct functional cell types in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) have been shown to represent different aspects of experiences. To further characterize mEC cell populations, we examined whether spatial representations of neurons in mEC superficial layers depended on the scale of the environment and changed over extended time periods. Accordingly, mEC cells were recorded while rats repeatedly foraged in a small or a large environment in sessions that were separated by time intervals from minutes to hours. Comparing between large and small environments, we found that the overall precision of grid and non-grid cell spatial maps was higher in smaller environments. When examining the stability of spatial firing patterns over time, differences and similarities were observed across cell types. Within-session stability was higher for grid cells than for non-grid cell populations. Despite differences in baseline stability between cell types, stability levels remained consistent over time between sessions, up to 1 hr. Even for sessions separated by 6 hrs, activity patterns of grid cells and of most non-grid cells lacked any systematic decrease in spatial similarity over time. However, a subset of \{\textbackslash{}textasciitilde\}15\% of mEC non-grid cells recorded preferentially from layer III exhibited dramatic, time dependent changes in firing patterns across 6 hrs, reminiscent of previous characterizations of the hippocampal CA2 subregion. Collectively, our data suggest that mEC grid cell input to hippocampus in conjunction with many time invariant non-grid cells may aid in stabilizing hippocampal spatial maps, while a subset of time varying non-grid cells could provide complementary temporal information.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus and the parahippocampal region have been proposed to contribute to path integration. Mice lacking GluA1-containing AMPA receptors (GluA1(-/-) mice) were previously shown to exhibit impaired hippocampal place cell selectivity. Here we investigated whether path integration performance and the activity of grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are affected in these mice. We first tested GluA1(-/-) mice on a standard food-carrying homing task and found that they were impaired in processing idiothetic cues. To corroborate these findings, we developed an L-maze task that is less complex and is performed entirely in darkness, thereby reducing numerous confounding variables when testing path integration. Also in this task, the performance of GluA1(-/-) mice was impaired. Next, we performed in vivo recordings in the MEC of GluA1(-/-) mice. MEC neurons exhibited altered grid cell spatial periodicity and reduced spatial selectivity, whereas head direction tuning and speed modulation were not affected. The firing associations between pairs of neurons in GluA1(-/-) mice were stable, both in time and space, indicating that attractor states were still present despite the lack of grid periodicity. Together, these results support the hypothesis that spatial representations in the hippocampal-entorhinal network contribute to path integration.},

Parvalbumin-immunopositive Teevra cells show the highest rhythmicity among MS neurons and fire with short burst duration (median, 38\&\#xA0;ms) preferentially at the trough of both CA1 theta and slow irregular oscillations, coincident with highest hippocampal excitability. Teevra cells synaptically target GABAergic axo-axonic and some CCK interneurons in restricted septo-temporal CA3 segments. The rhythmicity of their firing decreases from septal to temporal termination of individual axons. We hypothesize that Teevra neurons coordinate oscillatory activity across the septo-temporal axis, phasing the firing of specific CA3 interneurons, thereby contributing to the selection of pyramidal cell assemblies at the theta trough via disinhibition.

  abstract = {Hippocampal neurons show a strong modulation by theta frequency oscillations. This modulation is thought to be important not only for temporal encoding and decoding of information in the hippocampal system, but also for temporal ordering of neuronal activities on timescales at which physiological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity operate. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), one of the two major cortical inputs to the hippocampus, is known to show theta modulation. Here, we show that the local field potentials (LFPs) in the other major cortical input to the hippocampus, the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), show weaker theta oscillations than those shown in the MEC. Neurons in LEC also show weaker theta modulation than that of neurons in MEC. These findings suggest that LEC inputs are integrated into hippocampal representations in a qualitatively different manner than the MEC inputs. Furthermore, MEC grid cells increase the scale of their periodic spatial firing patterns along the dorsoventral axis, corresponding to the increasing size of place fields along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. We show here a corresponding gradient in the tendency of MEC neural firing to skip alternate theta cycles. We propose a simple model based on interference of delta oscillations with theta oscillations to explain this behavior.},

  abstract = {The formation and recall of sensory, motor, and cognitive representations require coordinated fast communication among multiple cortical areas. Interareal projections are mainly mediated by glutamatergic pyramidal cell projections; only few long-range GABAergic connections have been reported. Using in vivo recording and labeling of single cells and retrograde axonal tracing, we demonstrate novel long-range GABAergic projection neurons in the rat hippocampus: (1) somatostatin- and predominantly mGluR1alpha-positive neurons in stratum oriens project to the subiculum, other cortical areas, and the medial septum; (2) neurons in stratum oriens, including somatostatin-negative ones; and (3) trilaminar cells project to the subiculum and/or other cortical areas but not the septum. These three populations strongly increase their firing during sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, communicating this network state to the septotemporal system. Finally, a large population of somatostatin-negative GABAergic cells in stratum radiatum project to the molecular layers of the subiculum, presubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and indusium griseum and fire rhythmically at high rates during theta oscillations but do not increase their firing during ripples. The GABAergic projection axons have a larger diameter and thicker myelin sheet than those of CA1 pyramidal cells. Therefore, rhythmic IPSCs are likely to precede the arrival of excitation in cortical areas (e.g., subiculum) that receive both glutamatergic and GABAergic projections from the CA1 area. Other areas, including the retrosplenial cortex, receive only rhythmic GABAergic CA1 input. We conclude that direct GABAergic projections from the hippocampus to other cortical areas and the septum contribute to coordinating oscillatory timing across structures.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1939-5086},
  abstract = {We provide a concise review of recent studies related to the development of neural circuits supporting spatial navigation and memory in the rat. We chart the relative timeline of the emergence of the four main classes of spatially tuned neurons within the hippocampus and related limbic areas: head direction cells emerge earliest (postnatal day 12, P12), before the eyes of the rats are even open, followed by place cells and boundary responsive cells; grid cells emerge last, around the age of weaning (P21). The rate of maturation is unique to each type of neuron, with the head direction and grid cells showing rapid developmental spurts, in contrast to place cells, which show a more gradual trend of maturation. Interestingly, the emergence of allocentric spatial abilities occurs only after the full complement of spatial neurons becomes functional at P20\textendash{}21, whereas associative processing in the place cell network is evident from as early as P16. We also present evidence supporting the view that the sensory inputs, which are particularly salient to adult spatial networks, may not be essential for the immature spatial system. Crucially, visual information, although more salient than other sensory modalities for anchoring the adult head direction system, does not appear to be essential for setting up the immature head direction network. We conclude by highlighting an urgent need for new theoretical models that can account for the sequential emergence of spatial cells, as well as the lack of primacy of vision in the early organization of the head direction network.

  abstract = {1. The electroresponsive properties of neurons from layer II of the rat medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) were studied by intracellular recording under current clamp in an in vitro brain slice preparation. From a total of 184 cells that fulfilled our criteria for recording stability, two groups of projection neurons were distinguished on the basis of their intrinsic biophysical properties and morphological characteristics (demonstrated by intracellular biocytin injection; n = 34). 2. Stellate cells (SCs) were the most abundant (69\%). They were highly electroresponsive, and minimal changes (1-3 mV) of membrane potential generated an active response. Subthreshold depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulse injection always caused the membrane potential to attain an early peak and then sag to a lower level. Depolarization-induced "sags" were larger and determined early firing in all cells. The voltage-current relationship of SCs was markedly non-linear, demonstrating robust inward rectification in the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing range. 3. SCs generated persistent rhythmic subthreshold voltage oscillations on DC depolarization positive to -60 mV. The mean frequency of the oscillations was 8.6 Hz (theta range) at a membrane potential of approximately -55 mV, at which level occasional single spiking also occurred. At slightly more positive potentials, a striking 1- to 3-Hz repetitive bursting pattern emerged. This consisted of nonadapting trains of spikes ("clusters") interspersed with subthreshold oscillations that had a mean frequency of 21.7 Hz (beta range). 4. Nonstellate cells (39\%; mostly pyramidal-like) displayed time-dependent inward rectification that was less pronounced than that of SCs, and minimal depolarization-induced sags. On threshold depolarization, firing was always preceded by a slowly rising ramp depolarization and thus occurred with a long delay. Inward rectification in the depolarizing range was very pronounced. However, non-SCs did not generate persistent rhythmic subthreshold oscillatory activity or spike clusters. 5. Of the electrophysiological parameters quantified, spike threshold, spike duration, depolarizing afterpotential amplitude and apparent membrane time constant demonstrated statistically significant differences between SCs and non-SCs. 6. The repetitive hiring properties in response to square current pulses of short duration (\{\textbackslash{}textless\} 500 ms) were also different between SCs and non-SCs. First, most SCs displayed a bilinear frequency-current (f-I) relationship for only the first interspike interval, whereas most non-SCs displayed a bilinear relationship for all intervals. Second, SCs had a much steeper primary f-I slope for early intervals than non-SCs. Finally, SCs displayed more pronounced and faster spike frequency adaptation than non-SCs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Grid cells found in layer II of the MEC are likely to be stellate cells, which form a major projection to the dentate gyrus. Entorhinal stellate cells are distinguished by distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties, but how these properties contribute to representation of space is not yet clear. Here, we review the ionic conductances, synaptic, and excitable properties of stellate cells, and examine their implications for models of grid firing fields. We discuss why existing data are inconsistent with models of grid fields that require stellate cells to generate periodic oscillations. An alternative possibility is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of stellate cells are tuned specifically to control integration of synaptic input. We highlight recent evidence that the dorsal-ventral organization of synaptic integration by stellate cells, through differences in currents mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels, influences the corresponding organization of grid fields. Because accurate cellular data will be important for distinguishing mechanisms for generation of grid fields, we introduce new data comparing properties measured with whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings. We find that clustered patterns of action potential firing and the action potential after-hyperpolarization (AHP) are particularly sensitive to recording condition. Nevertheless, with both methods, these properties, resting membrane properties and resonance follow a dorsal-ventral organization. Further investigation of the molecular basis for synaptic integration by stellate cells will be important for understanding mechanisms for generation of grid fields.},

The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has been suggested to play a pivotal role in this process. Grid cells, head-direction cells, border cells as well as speed cells within the MEC collectively provide a dynamic representation of the animal position in space based on the integration of self-movements. All these cells are strongly modulated by theta oscillations, thus suggesting that theta rhythmicity in the MEC may be essential for integrating and coordinating self-movement information during navigation. In this study, we first show that excitotoxic MEC lesions, but not dorsal hippocampal lesions, impair the ability of rats to estimate linear distances based on self-movement information. Next, we report similar deficits following medial septum inactivation, which strongly impairs theta oscillations in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuits. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a major role of the MEC and MS in estimating distances to be traveled, and point to theta oscillations within the MEC as a neural mechanism responsible for the integration of information generated by linear self-displacements.},

To determine how this network is set up during early postnatal development, we monitored markers of structural maturation in developing mice, both in na\&\#xEF;ve animals and after temporally restricted pharmacogenetic silencing of specific cell populations. We found that entorhinal stellate cells provide an activity-dependent instructive signal that drives maturation sequentially and unidirectionally through the intrinsic circuits of the entorhinal-hippocampal network The findings raise the possibility that a small number of autonomously developing neuronal populations operate as intrinsic drivers of maturation across widespread regions of cortex.},

  abstract = {Grid cells are neurons with periodic spatial receptive fields (grids) that tile two-dimensional space in a hexagonal pattern. To provide useful information about location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.},

  abstract = {Whereas recent studies have elucidated principles for representation of information within the entorhinal cortex, less is known about the molecular basis for information processing by entorhinal neurons. The HCN1 gene encodes ion channels that mediate hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) that control synaptic integration and influence several forms of learning and memory. We asked whether hyperpolarization-activated, cation nonselective 1 (HCN1) channels control processing of information by stellate cells found within layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Axonal projections from these neurons form a major component of the synaptic input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. To determine whether HCN1 channels control either the resting or the active properties of stellate neurons, we performed whole-cell recordings in horizontal brain slices prepared from adult wild-type and HCN1 knock-out mice. We found that HCN1 channels are required for rapid and full activation of hyperpolarization-activated currents in stellate neurons. HCN1 channels dominate the membrane conductance at rest, are not required for theta frequency (4\textendash{}12 Hz) membrane potential fluctuations, but suppress low-frequency (\{\textbackslash{}textless\}4 Hz) components of spontaneous and evoked membrane potential activity. During sustained activation of stellate cells sufficient for firing of repeated action potentials, HCN1 channels control the pattern of spike output by promoting recovery of the spike afterhyperpolarization. These data suggest that HCN1 channels expressed by stellate neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex are key molecular components in the processing of inputs to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, with distinct integrative roles during resting and active states.},

In the medial entorhinal cortex, inhibitory circuits are robust, and the presence of the h-current leads to rebound potentials and rebound spiking in in vitro experiments. It has been hypothesized that these properties, combined with network oscillations, may contribute to grid cell formation. To examine the properties of in vivo rebound spikes, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in medial entorhinal cortex neurons in anaesthetized mice. We injected hyperpolarizing inputs representing inhibitory synaptic inputs along with sinusoidal oscillations and found that hyperpolarizing inputs injected at specific phases of oscillation had a higher probability of inducing subsequent spikes at the peak of the oscillation in some neurons. This effect was prominent in the cells with large sag potential, which is a marker of the h-current. In addition, larger and longer hyperpolarizing current square-pulse stimulation resulted in a larger probability of eliciting rebound spikes, though we did not observe a relationship between the amplitude or duration of hyperpolarizing current pulse stimulation and the delay of rebound spikes. Overall these results suggest that rebound spikes are observed in vivo and may play a role in generating grid cell activity in medial entorhinal cortex neurons.},

  abstract = {Medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas are crucial for memory tasks such as spatial working memory and temporal association memory, which require an active maintenance of memory for a short period of time (a few hundred milliseconds to tens of seconds). Recent work has shown that the projection from layer III neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to hippocampal region CA1, the temporoammonic (TA) pathway, might be specially important for these memory tasks. In addition, lesions to the entorhinal cortex disrupt persistent firing in CA1 which is believed to support active maintenance of memory. Injection of cholinergic antagonists and group I mGlu receptor antagonists to the MEC impairs spatial working memory and temporal association memory. Consistent with this, we have shown that group I mGlu receptor activation supports persistent firing in principal cells of the MEC layer III in vitro (Yoshida et al. [39]). However, it still remains unknown whether cholinergic receptor activation also supports persistent firing in MEC layer III neurons. In this paper, we tested this in MEC layer III cells using both ruptured and perforated whole-cell recordings in vitro. We report that the majority of cells we recorded from in MEC layer III show persistent firing during perfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (2\textendash{}10{$\mu$}M). In addition, repeated stimulation gradually suppressed persistent firing. We further discuss the possible role of persistent firing in memory function in general.},

  abstract = {Wolframin (Wfs1) is a membrane glycoprotein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and regulates cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In pancreas Wfs1 attenuates unfolded protein response (UPR) and protects cells from apoptosis. Loss of Wfs1 function results in Wolfram syndrome (OMIM 222300) characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and psychiatric disorders. Similarly, Wfs1-/- mice exhibit diabetes and increased basal anxiety. In the adult central nervous system Wfs1 is prominent in central extended amygdala, striatum and hippocampus, brain structures largely involved in behavioral adaptation of the organism. Here, we describe the initiation pattern of Wfs1 expression in mouse forebrain using mRNA in situ hybridization and compare it with Synaptophysin (Syp1), a gene encoding synaptic vesicle protein widely used as neuronal differentiation marker. We show that the expression of Wfs1 starts during late embryonic development in the dorsal striatum and amygdala, then expands broadly at birth, possessing several transitory regions during maturation. Syp1 expression precedes Wfs1 and it is remarkably upregulated during the period of Wfs1 expression initiation and maturation, suggesting relationship between neural activation and Wfs1 expression. Using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR we show that UPR-related genes (Grp78, Grp94, and Chop) display dynamic expression in the perinatal brain when Wfs1 is initiated and their expression pattern is not altered in the brain lacking functional Wfs1.},

We further propose that mind-travel occurs during the second half of each theta cycle. By contrast, the first half of each theta cycle is devoted to computing current position using sensory information from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and path integration information from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC).

We studied their effects on GABAergic transmission and epileptiform activity in the entorhinal cortex (EC). Bath application of bombesin concentration-dependently increased both the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs recorded from the principal neurons in the EC. Application of NMB and GRP exerted the same effects as bombesin. Bombesin had no effects on mIPSCs recorded in the presence of TTX but slightly depressed the evoked IPSCs. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ or inclusion of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers, Cd2+ and Ni2+, blocked bombesin-induced increases in sIPSCs suggesting that bombesin increases GABA release via facilitating extracellular Ca2+ influx. Bombesin induced membrane depolarization and slightly increased the input resistance of GABAergic interneurons recorded from layer III of the EC. The action potential firing frequency of the interneurons was also increased by bombesin. Bombesin-mediated depolarization of interneurons was unlikely to be mediated by the opening of a cationic conductance but due to the inhibition of inward rectifier K+ channels. Bath application of bombesin, NMB and GRP depressed the frequency of the epileptiform activity elicited by deprivation of Mg2+ from the extracellular solution suggesting that bombesin and the bombesin-like peptides have antiepileptic effects in the brain. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here, we present a method for in vivo, subcellular resolution optical access to the mPFC and MEC using microprisms inserted into the fissures. We chronically imaged the mPFC and MEC in mice running on a spherical treadmill, using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and genetically encoded calcium indicators to measure network activity. In the MEC, we imaged grid cells, a widely studied cell type essential to memory and spatial information processing. These cells exhibited spatially modulated activity during navigation in a virtual reality environment. This method should be extendable to other brain regions situated within deep fissures, and opens up these regions for study at cellular resolution in behaving animals using a rapidly expanding palette of optical tools for perturbing and measuring network structure and function.},

We have observed that this typically involves the medial rather than the lateral portion of the anterior hippocampus. Here, we investigated which specific structures of the hippocampus underpin this observation. We had participants imagine novel scenes during fMRI scanning, as well as recall previously learned scenes from two different time periods (one week and 30 min prior to scanning), with analogous single object conditions as baselines. Using an extended segmentation protocol focussing on anterior hippocampus, we first investigated which substructures of the hippocampus respond to scenes, and found both imagination and recall of scenes to be associated with activity in presubiculum/parasubiculum, a region associated with spatial representation in rodents. Next, we compared imagining novel scenes to recall from one week or 30 min before scanning. We expected a strong response to imagining novel scenes and 1-week recall, as both involve constructing scene representations from elements stored across cortex. By contrast, we expected a weaker response to 30-min recall, as representations of these scenes had already been constructed but not yet consolidated. Both imagination and 1-week recall of scenes engaged anterior hippocampal structures (anterior subiculum and uncus respectively), indicating possible roles in scene construction. By contrast, 30-min recall of scenes elicited significantly less activation of anterior hippocampus but did engage posterior CA3. Together, these results elucidate the functions of different parts of the anterior hippocampus, a key brain area about which little is definitely known.},

On the other hand, we identified many similarities with the rat: both the CA1 and subicular afferents that originated from the entorhinal cortex were abundant; moreover, the presubiculum received many inputs from the subiculum and sent massive projections to the entorhinal cortex. By plotting retrograde and anterograde labels in two-dimensional unfolded maps of the entire hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, we found that each group of entorhinal cells that project to CA1, subiculum, and presubiculum, and also the termination of the presubiculo-entorhinal projection, was distributed in band-like zones in layers II\textendash{}III, extending across the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex.

However, it is not clear what types of neurons in the EC are sensitive to nicotine and whether they play a role in nicotine-induced memory functions. Here, we have used voltage-sensitive dye imaging methods to locate the neuronal populations responsive to nicotine in entorhino-hippocampal slices and to clarify which nAChR subtypes are involved. In combination with patch-clamp methods, we found that a concentration of nicotine comparable to exposure during smoking depolarized neurons in layer VI of the EC (ECVI) by acting through the non-{$\alpha$}7 subtype of nAChRs. Neurons in the subiculum (Sb; close to the deep EC layers) also contain nicotine-sensitive neurons, and it is known that Sb neurons project to the ECVI. When we recorded evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) from ECVI neurons while stimulating the Sb near the CA1 region, a low dose of nicotine not only enhanced synaptic transmission (by increasing eEPSC amplitude) but also enhanced plasticity by converting tetanus stimulation-induced short-term potentiation to long-term potentiation; nicotine enhanced synaptic transmission and plasticity of ECVI synapses by acting on both the {$\alpha$}7 and non-{$\alpha$}7 subtypes of nAChRs.

  abstract = {The superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contain spatially selective neurons that are crucial for spatial navigation and memory. These highly specialized neurons include grid cells, border cells, head-direction cells, and irregular spatially selective cells. In addition, MEC neurons display a large variability in their spike patterns at a millisecond time scale. In this study, we analyzed spike trains of neurons in the MEC superficial layers of mice and found that these neurons can be classified into two groups based on their propensity to fire spike doublets at 125\textendash{}250 Hz. The two groups, labeled ``bursty'' and ``non-bursty'' neurons, differed in their spike waveforms and interspike interval adaptation but displayed a similar mean firing rate. Grid cell spatial periodicity was more commonly observed in bursty than in non-bursty neurons. In contrast, most neurons with head-direction selectivity or those that fired at the border of the environment were non-bursty neurons. During theta oscillations, both bursty and non-bursty neurons fired preferentially near the end of the descending phase of the cycle, but the spikes of bursty neurons occurred at an earlier phase than those of non-bursty neurons. Finally, analysis of spike-time crosscorrelations between simultaneously recorded neurons suggested that the two cell classes are differentially coupled to fast-spiking interneurons: bursty neurons were twice as likely to have excitatory interactions with putative interneurons as non-bursty neurons. These results demonstrate that bursty and non-bursty neurons are differentially integrated in the MEC network and preferentially encode distinct spatial signals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We report that neurons in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex can be classified based on their tendency to fire bursts of action potentials at 125\textendash{}250 Hz. The relevance of this classification is demonstrated by the types of spatial information preferentially encoded by bursty and non-bursty neurons. Grid-like spatial periodicity is more commonly observed in bursty neurons, whereas most cells with head-direction selectivity or those that are firing at the border of the environment are non-bursty neurons. This work indicates that the spatial firing patterns of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex can be predicted by electrophysiological features reflecting the synaptic inputs and/or integrating properties of the neurons.},

When animals move, activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal's displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These `speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of \{\textbackslash{}textasciitilde\}50\textendash{}80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.},

To determine whether grid cell activity reflects distance traveled or elapsed time independent of external information, we recorded grid cells as animals ran in place on a treadmill. Grid cell activity was only weakly influenced by location, but most grid cells and other neurons recorded from the same electrodes strongly signaled a combination of distance and time, with some signaling only distance or time. Grid cells were more sharply tuned to time and distance than non-grid cells. Many grid cells exhibited multiple firing fields during treadmill running, parallel to the periodic firing fields observed in open fields, suggesting a common mode of information processing. These observations indicate that, in the absence of external dynamic cues, grid cells integrate self-generated distance and time information to encode a representation of experience.},

The anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin-L and biotinylated dextran amine were injected into the subiculum at different septotemporal and transverse levels. Deep layers of the ento-, peri-, and postrhinal cortices are the main recipients of subicular projections, but in all cases we noted that a small fraction of the projections also terminates in the superficial layers II and III. Analysis of the fiber patterns in the parahippocampal region revealed a topographic organization, depending on the location of the cells of origin along both the transverse and the septotemporal axes of the subiculum. Projections originating from subicular cells close to CA1, i.e., proximal part of subiculum, terminate exclusively in the lateral entorhinal cortex and in the perirhinal cortex. In contrast, projections from cells closer to the subiculum-presubiculum border, i.e., distal part of subiculum, terminate in the medial entorhinal cortex and in the postrhinal cortex. In addition, cells in septal portions of the subiculum project to a lateral band of entorhinal cortex parallel to the rhinal sulcus and to peri- or postrhinal cortices, whereas cells in more temporal portions project to more medial parts of the entorhinal cortex. These results indicate that subicular projections to the parahippocampal region precisely reciprocate the known inputs from this region to the hippocampal formation. We thus suggest that the reciprocal connectivity between the subiculum and the parahippocampal region is organized as parallel pathways that serve to segregate information flow and thus maintain the identity of processed information. Although this parallel organization is comparable to that of the CA1-parahippocampal projections, differences exist with respect to the degree of collateralization.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms underlying grid cell firing in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) still remain unknown. Computational modeling studies have suggested that cellular properties such as spike frequency adaptation and persistent firing might underlie the grid cell firing. Recent in vivo studies also suggest that cholinergic activation influences grid cell firing. Here we investigated the anatomical distribution of firing frequency adaptation, the medium spike after hyperpolarization potential (mAHP), subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, sag potential, input resistance and persistent firing, in MEC layer II principal cells using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings in rats. Anatomical distributions of these properties were compared along both the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes, both with and without the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol. We found that spike frequency adaptation is significantly stronger in ventral than in dorsal neurons both with and without carbachol. Spike frequency adaptation was significantly correlated with the duration of the mAHP, which also showed a gradient along the dorso-ventral axis. In carbachol, we found that about 50\% of MEC layer II neurons show persistent firing which lasted more than 30 seconds. Persistent firing of MEC layer II neurons might contribute to grid cell firing by providing the excitatory drive. Dorso-ventral differences in spike frequency adaptation we report here are opposite from previous predictions by a computational model. We discuss an alternative mechanism as to how dorso-ventral differences in spike frequency adaptation could contribute to different scales of grid spacing.},

The function of this system, however, has not been fully established. To assess this, we devised a novel spatial landmark task, comparable to the paradigms in which stimulus control has been assessed for spatially tuned neurons. The task took place in a large cylinder and required rats to dig in a specific sand cup, from among 16 alternatives, to obtain a food reward. The reinforced cup was in a fixed location relative to a salient landmark, and probe sessions confirmed that the landmark exerted stimulus control over the rats' cup choices. To assess the contribution of the head direction cell system to this memory task, half of the animals received ibotenic acid infusions into the lateral mammillary nuclei (LMN), an essential node in the head direction network, while the other received sham lesions. No differences were observed in performance of this task between the 2 groups. Animals with LMN lesions were impaired, however, in reversal learning on a water maze task. These results suggest that the LMN, and potentially the head direction cell system, are not essential for the use of visual landmarks to guide spatial behavior.},

  abstract = {Modelling entorhinal function or evaluating the consequences of neuronal losses which accompany neurodegenerative disorders requires detailed information on the quantitative cellular composition of the normal entorhinal cortex. Using design-based stereological methods, we estimated the numbers, proportions, densities and sectional areas of layer II cells in the medial entorhinal area (MEA), and its constituent caudal entorhinal (CE) and medial entorhinal (ME) fields, in the rat and mouse. We estimated layer II of the MEA to contain {$\sim$}58,000 neurons in the rat and {$\sim$}24,000 neurons in the mouse. Field CE accounted for more than three-quarters of the total neuron population in both species. In the rat, layer II of the MEA is comprised of 38\% ovoid stellate cells, 29\% polygonal stellate cells and 17\% pyramidal cells. The remainder is comprised of much smaller populations of horizontal bipolar, tripolar, oblique pyramidal and small round cells. In the mouse, MEA layer II is comprised of 52\% ovoid stellate cells, 22\% polygonal stellate cells and 14\% pyramidal cells. Significant species differences in the proportions of ovoid and polygonal stellate cells suggest differences in physiological and functional properties. The majority of MEA layer II cells contribute to the entorhinal-hippocampal pathways. The degree of divergence from MEA layer II cells to the dentate granule cells was similar in the rat and mouse. In both rat and mouse, the only dorsoventral difference we observed is a gradient in polygonal stellate cell sectional area, which may relate to the dorsoventral increase in the size and spacing of individual neuronal firing fields. In summary, we found species-specific cellular compositions of MEA layer II, while, within a species, quantitative parameters other than cell size are stable along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axis of the MEA.},

Since the discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, neurophysiological data and computational models have suggested that these neurons serve PI. However, more direct empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis has been missing due to a lack of selective manipulations of grid cell activity and suitable behavioral assessments. Here we report that selective disruption of grid cell activity in mice can be achieved by removing NMDA glutamate receptors from the retro-hippocampal region and that disrupted grid cell firing accounts for impaired PI performance. Notably, the genetic manipulation did not affect the activity of other spatially selective cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. By directly linking grid cell activity to PI, these results contribute to a better understanding of how grid cells support navigation and spatial memory. Grid cell activity may subserve path integration, but a direct link is lacking. The authors selectively disrupt retro-hippocampal region grid cell activity and show that disrupted grid cell firing impairs performance in a path integration task.},

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of epilepsy in adults, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. Layer II stellate cells of the entorhinal cortex, which are hyperexcitable in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, provide the predominant synaptic input to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Previous studies have ascribed the hyperexcitability of layer II stellate cells to GABAergic interneurons becoming ``dormant'' after disconnection from their excitatory synaptic inputs, which has been reported to occur during preferential loss of layer III pyramidal cells. We used whole-cell recording from slices of entorhinal cortex in pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats to test the dormant interneuron hypothesis. Hyperexcitability appeared as multiple action potentials and prolonged depolarizations evoked in layer II stellate cells of epileptic rats but not controls. However, blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission caused similar percentage reductions in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in layer II stellate cells of control and epileptic rats, suggesting similar levels of excitatory synaptic input to GABAergic interneurons. Direct recordings and biocytin labeling revealed two major types of interneurons in layer III whose excitatory synaptic drive in epileptic animals was undiminished. Interneurons in layer III did not appear to be dormant; therefore, we tested whether loss of GABAergic synapses might underlie hyperexcitability of layer II stellate cells. Stereological evidence of fewer GABAergic interneurons, fewer gephyrin-immunoreactive punctae, and reduced frequency of spontaneous IPSCs and miniature IPSCs (recorded in tetrodotoxin) confirmed that layer II stellate cell hyperexcitability is attributable, at least in part, to reduced inhibitory synaptic input.},

In addition, MEC rats were as impaired in the water maze as hippocampus rats, while rats with combined MEC and hippocampal lesions had an even greater deficit. However, MEC rats were not impaired on other hippocampus-dependent tasks, including those in which an object location or context was remembered. Thus, the MEC is not necessary for all types of spatial coding or for all types of hippocampus-dependent memory, but it is necessary for the normal acquisition of place memory.},

  abstract = {Neurons coding spatial location (grid cells) are found in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and demonstrate increasing size of firing fields and spacing between fields (grid scale) along the dorsoventral axis. This change in grid scale correlates with differences in theta frequency, a 6\textendash{}10Hz rhythm in the local field potential (LFP) and rhythmic firing of cells. A relationship between theta frequency and grid scale can be found when examining grid cells recorded in different locations along the dorsoventral axis of MEC.When describing the relationship between theta frequency and grid scale, it is important to account for the strong positive correlation between theta frequency and running speed. Plotting LFP theta frequency across running speeds dissociates two components of this relationship: slope and intercept of the linear fit. Change in theta frequency through a change in the slope component has been modeled and shown experimentally to affect grid scale, but the prediction that change in the intercept component would not affect grid scale has not been tested experimentally. This prediction about the relationship of intercept to grid scale is the primary hypothesis tested in the experiments presented here.All known anxiolytic drugs decrease hippocampal theta frequency despite their differing mechanisms of action. Specifically, anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the MEC, similar to hippocampus, and the decrease in frequency through this change in intercept does not affect grid scale.},

Depolarization of MECII impaired spatial memory and elicited drastic changes in CA1 place cells in a familiar environment, similar to those seen during remapping between distinct environments, while hyperpolarization did not. In contrast, both manipulations altered the firing rate of MEC neurons without changing their firing locations. Interestingly, only depolarization caused significant changes in the relative firing rates of individual grid fields, reconfiguring the spatial input from MEC.

For this analysis, the full network was decomposed along the three anatomical axes, resulting in three networks that describe the connectivity within the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral and laminar dimensions. The rostrocaudal network had a connection density of 12 \% and a path length of 2.4. The dorsoventral network had a high cluster coefficient (0.53), a relatively high path length (1.62) and a rich club was identified. The modularity analysis revealed three modules in the dorsoventral network. The laminar network contained most information. The laminar dimension revealed a network with high clustering coefficient (0.47), a relatively high path length (2.11) and four significantly increased characteristic network building blocks (structural motifs). Thirteen rich club nodes were identified, almost all of them situated in the parahippocampal region. Six connector hubs were detected and all of them were located in the entorhinal cortex. Three large modules were revealed, indicating a close relationship between the perirhinal and postrhinal cortex as well as between the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex. These results confirmed the central position of the entorhinal cortex in the (para)hippocampal network and this possibly explains why pathology in this region has such profound impact on cognitive function, as seen in several brain diseases. The results also have implications for the idea of strict separation of the ``spatial'' and the ``non-spatial'' information stream into the hippocampus. This two-stream memory model suggests that the information influx from, respectively, the postrhinal\textendash{}medial entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal\textendash{}lateral entorhinal cortex is separate, but the current analysis shows that this apparent separation is not determined by anatomical constraints.},

The subiculum represents the main hippocampal output and contains both regular spiking and burst firing neurons that may project to different targets in the CNS. We recorded laminar profiles and intracellular correlates of spontaneous subicular events in mouse horizontal hippocampal slices and investigated involvement of the different subtypes of subicular pyramidal cells. Subicular sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) depend on input from the CA3 and CA1 regions as shown by microdissection experiments between hippocampal subareas. The extracellular subicular waves are associated with multiple unit activity, which varies in form and size. Intracellular recordings reveal that the same pyramidal cell can show different responses to SWRs. In the majority of cases, SWRs cause subthreshold depolarizing potentials. Burster neurons regularly contribute to generation of SWRs by action potential firing, whereas regular-spiking neurons are often inhibited.},

The interaction between the entorhinal and hippocampal spatial representations is poorly understood, however. We have developed an optogenetic strategy to identify functionally defined cell types in the MEC that project directly to the hippocampus. By expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in the hippocampus-projecting subset of entorhinal projection neurons, we were able to use light-evoked discharge as an instrument to determine whether specific entorhinal cell groups\textemdash{}such as grid cells, border cells and head-direction cells\textemdash{}have direct hippocampal projections. Photoinduced firing was observed at fixed minimal latencies in all functional cell categories, with grid cells as the most abundant hippocampus-projecting spatial cell type. We discuss how photoexcitation experiments can be used to distinguish the subset of hippocampus-projecting entorhinal neurons from neurons that are activated indirectly through the network. The functional breadth of entorhinal input implied by this analysis opens up the potential for rich dynamic interactions between place cells in the hippocampus and different functional cell types in the entorhinal cortex (EC).},

  abstract = {The subiculum is the output component of the hippocampal formation and holds a key position in the neural circuitry of memory. Previous studies have demonstrated the subiculum's connectivity to other brain areas in detail; however, little is known regarding its internal structure. We investigated the cytoarchitecture of the temporal and mid-septotemporal parts of the subiculum using immunohistochemistry. The border between the CA1 region and subiculum was determined by both cytoarchitecture and zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3)-immunoreactivity (IR), whereas the border between the subiculum and presubiculum (PreS) was partially indicated by glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1)-IR. The subiculum was divided into proximal and distal subfields based on cytoarchitecture and immunohistochemistry for calbindin (CB), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4). The proximal subiculum (defined here as subiculum 2) was composed of five layers: the molecular layer (layer 1), the medium-sized pyramidal cell layer (layer 2) that contained NOS- and PCP4-positive neurons, the large pyramidal cell layer (layer 3) characterized by the accumulation of ZnT3- (more proximally) and vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive (more distally) boutons, layer 4 containing polymorphic cells, and the deepest layer 5 composed of PCP4-positive cells with long apical dendrites that reached layer 1. The distal subiculum (subiculum 1) consisting of smaller neurons did not show these features. Quantitative analyses of the size and numerical density of somata substantiated this delineation. Both the proximal-distal division and five-layered structure in the subiculum 2 were confirmed throughout the temporal two-thirds of the subiculum. These findings will provide a new structural basis for hippocampal investigations.},

We find that neurons in layers 5a and 5b have distinct molecular identities, defined by the transcription factors Etv1 and Ctip2, and divergent targets, with extensive intratelencephalic projections originating in layer 5a, but not 5b. This segregation of outputs is mirrored by the organization of glutamatergic input from stellate cells in layer 2 and from the hippocampus, with both preferentially targeting layer 5b over 5a.

  volume = {35},
  issn = {0270-6474},
  abstract = {The postrhinal cortex (POR) provides substantial input to the entorhinal cortex, mainly targeting superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Major inputs to POR originate in the visual and parietal cortex, thus providing neurons in MEC with a subset of cortical information relevant to their spatial firing properties. The POR takes a position that is comparable with that of the perirhinal cortex (PER) with regard to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). Neurons in LEC and MEC show different functional properties likely reflecting differences in their respective inputs. Projections from PER to LEC exert a main inhibitory influence, which may relate to the sparse object-selective firing in LEC. In view of the continuous, spatially modulated firing properties of principal neurons in MEC, we tested in rats the hypothesis that projections from POR to MEC are functionally different from the PER-to-LEC counterpart in providing an excitatory drive to MEC. Our combined confocal and quantitative electron-microscopic observations indicated that POR projections target mainly principal cells in MEC, including neurons that project to the hippocampus. The ultrastructure of the majority of the synapses indicated that they are excitatory. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging in sagittal slices confirmed this morphologically derived conclusion, showing that the MEC network always responded with an overall depolarization, indicative for net excitatory transmission. In vitro single-cell recordings from principal cells showed only excitatory responses upon POR stimulation. These results show that POR provides an excitatory projection to MEC, differing fundamentally from the inhibitory projection of PER to LEC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The study provides anatomical and electrophysiological data indicating that projections from the postrhinal cortex to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are excitatory, providing the substrate for high probability of information transfer and thus a continuous input stream into MEC. This is a relevant component of the spatial navigational network found in MEC. The findings are in contrast to previous reports on the parallel pathway from the perirhinal cortex to the lateral entorhinal cortex. This pathway, characterized by a preponderance of inhibitory connections, mediates information transfer with a low probability, likely related to the discontinuous object-related firing of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex.},

  abstract = {Principal cells in layer V of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) have a nodal position in the cortical\textendash{}hippocampal network. They are the main recipients of hippocampal output and receive inputs from several cortical areas, including a prominent one from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), likely targeting basal dendrites of layer V neurons. The latter project to extrahippocampal structures but also relay information to the superficial layers of MEC, closing the hippocampal\textendash{}entorhinal loop. In the rat, we electrophysiologically and morphologically characterized RSC input into MEC and conclude that RSC provides an excitatory input to layer V pyramidal cells. Ultrastructural analyses of anterogradely labeled RSC projections showed that RSC axons in layer V of MEC form predominantly asymmetrical, likely excitatory, synapses on dendritic spines (90\%) or shafts (8\%), with 2\% symmetrical, likely inhibitory, synapses on shafts and spines. The overall excitatory nature of the RSC input was confirmed by an optogenetic approach. Patterned laser stimulation of channelrhodopsin-expressing presynaptic RSC axons evoked exclusively EPSPs in recorded postsynaptic layer V cells. All responding layer V pyramidal cells had an axon extending toward the white matter. Half of these neurons also sent an axon to superficial layers. Confocal imaging of RSC synapses onto MEC layer V neurons shown to project superficially by way of retrogradely labeling from superficial layers confirmed that proximal dendrites of superficially projecting cells are among the targets of inputs from RSC. The excitatory RSC input thus interacts with both entorhinal\textendash{}cortical and entorhinal\textendash{}hippocampal circuits.},

  abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampus are reciprocally connected. Neurons in the superficial layers of EC project to the hippocampus, whereas deep entorhinal layers receive return connections. In the deep layers of EC, pyramidal neurons in layer V possess apical dendrites that ascend towards the cortical surface through layers IIII and II. These dendrites ramify in layer I. By way of their apical dendrites, such layer-V pyramidal cells may be exposed to input destined for the superficial entorhinal neurons. A specific and dense fiber projection that typically ends in superficial entorhinal layers of the medial EC originates in the presubiculum. To investigate whether apical dendrites of deep entorhinal pyramidal neurons indeed receive input from this projection, we injected the anterograde tracer PHA-L in the presubiculum or we lesioned the presubiculum, and we applied in the same experiments the tracer Neurobiotin\texttrademark{} pericellularly in layer V of the medial EC of 17 rats. PHA-L labeled presubiculum axons in the superficial layers apposing apical segments of Neurobiotin labeled layer-V cell dendrites were studied with a confocal fluorescence laserscanning microscope. Axons and dendrites were 3D reconstructed from series of confocal images. In cases in which the presubiculum had been lesioned, material was investigated in the electron microscope. At the confocal fluorescence microscope level we found numerous close contacts, i.e. appositions of boutons on labeled presubiculum fibers with identified dendrites of layer-V neurons. In the electron microscope we observed synapses between degenerating axon terminals and spines on dendrites belonging to layer-V neurons. Hence we conclude that layer-V neurons receive synaptic contacts from presubiculum neurons. These findings indicate that entorhinal layer-V neurons have access to information destined for the superficial layers and eventually the hippocampal formation. At the same time, they have access to the hippocampally processed version of that information.},

  abstract = {The presubiculum, located between hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, plays a fundamental role in representing spatial information, notably head direction. Little is known about GABAergic interneurons of this region. Here, we used three transgenic mouse lines, Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre, and X98, to examine distinct interneurons labeled with tdTomato or green fluorescent protein. The distribution of interneurons in presubicular lamina for each animal line was compared to that in the GAD67-GFP knock-in animal line. Labeling was specific in the Pvalb-Cre line with 87\% of labeled interneurons immunopositive for parvalbumin (PV). Immunostaining for somatostatin (SOM) revealed good specificity in the X98 line with 89\% of fluorescent cells, but a lesser specificity in Sst-Cre animals where only 71\% of labeled cells were immunopositive. A minority of {$\sim$}6\% of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre, and X98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance.},

  abstract = {The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial navigation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, while somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive ATN activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feed-forward inhibition is largely mediated by PV interneurons which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells. Our data point to a specific role of presubicular microcircuits in shaping thalamic head-direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex: Short-latency PV cell activation may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during fast turns. However, depression at ATN-PV synapses during repeated activation tends to facilitate pyramidal cell firing when head direction is maintained. Operations performed in presubicular layer 3 circuits seem well-adapted for spatial fine-tuning of head direction signals sent to the medial entorhinal cortex.},

Network topology showed layer-specific organization of microcircuits consistent with the prevailing distinction of superficial and deep layers. While connections among pyramidal cells were almost absent in superficial layers, deep layers exhibited an excitatory connectivity of 3.9\%. In contrast, synaptic connectivity for inhibition was higher in superficial layers though markedly lower than in other cortical areas. Finally, synaptic amplitudes of both excitatory and inhibitory connections showed log-normal distributions suggesting a nonrandom functional connectivity. In summary, our study provides new insights into the microcircuit organization of the presubiculum by revealing area- and layer-specific connectivity rules and sets new constraints for future models of the parahippocampal navigation system.},

Entorhinal grid cells provide inputs to the hippocampus, and their firing patterns shift relative to each other across different environments. Although this suggests that altered grid cell firing could generate distinct hippocampal population codes, it has recently been shown that new and distinct hippocampal place fields emerge while grid cell firing is compromised.

This Review discusses what is currently known about the neuroanatomy and neurotransmitters involved in amygdalo-hippocampal interconnections, their functional roles in learning and memory, and their involvement in mnemonic dysfunctions associated with neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. Tract tracing studies have shown that the interconnections between discrete amygdalar nuclei and distinct layers of individual hippocampal/parahippocampal regions are robust and complex. Although it is well established that glutamatergic pyramidal cells in the amygdala and hippocampal region are the major players mediating interconnections between these regions, recent studies suggest that long-range GABAergic projection neurons are also involved. Whereas neuroanatomical studies indicate that the amygdala only has direct interconnections with the ventral hippocampal region, electrophysiological studies and behavioral studies investigating fear conditioning and extinction, as well as amygdalar modulation of hippocampal-dependent mnemonic functions, suggest that the amygdala interacts with dorsal hippocampal regions via relays in the parahippocampal cortices. Possible pathways for these indirect interconnections, based on evidence from previous tract tracing studies, are discussed in this Review. Finally, memory disorders associated with dysfunction or damage to the amygdala, hippocampal region, and/or their interconnections are discussed in relation to Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and temporal lobe epilepsy. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Neural circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode an animal's position and orientation in space. Within the MEC spatial representations, including grid and directional firing fields, have a laminar and dorsoventral organization that corresponds to a similar topography of neuronal connectivity and cellular properties. Yet, in part due to the challenges of integrating anatomical data at the resolution of cortical layers and borders, we know little about the molecular components underlying this organization. To address this we develop a new computational pipeline for high-throughput analysis and comparison of in situ hybridization (ISH) images at laminar resolution. We apply this pipeline to ISH data for over 16,000 genes in the Allen Brain Atlas and validate our analysis with RNA sequencing of MEC tissue from adult mice. We find that differential gene expression delineates the borders of the MEC with neighboring brain structures and reveals its laminar and dorsoventral organization. We propose a new molecular basis for distinguishing the deep layers of the MEC and show that their similarity to corresponding layers of neocortex is greater than that of superficial layers. Our analysis identifies ion channel-, cell adhesion- and synapse-related genes as candidates for functional differentiation of MEC layers and for encoding of spatial information at different scales along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC. We also reveal laminar organization of genes related to disease pathology and suggest that a high metabolic demand predisposes layer II to neurodegenerative pathology. In principle, our computational pipeline can be applied to high-throughput analysis of many forms of neuroanatomical data. Our results support the hypothesis that differences in gene expression contribute to functional specialization of superficial layers of the MEC and dorsoventral organization of the scale of spatial representations.},

  abstract = {To understand the structural basis of grid cell activity, we compare medial entorhinal cortex architecture in layer 2 across five mammalian species (Etruscan shrews, mice, rats, Egyptian fruit bats, and humans), bridging \&\#x223C;100 million years of evolutionary diversity. Principal neurons in layer 2 are divided into two distinct cell types, pyramidal and stellate, based on morphology, immunoreactivity, and functional properties. We confirm the existence of patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal cells across these species, arranged periodically according to analyses techniques like spatial autocorrelation, grid scores, and modifiable areal unit analysis. In rodents, which show sustained theta oscillations in entorhinal cortex, cholinergic innervation targeted calbindin patches. In bats and humans, which only show intermittent entorhinal theta activity, cholinergic innervation avoided calbindin patches. The organization of calbindin-negative and calbindin-positive cells showed marked differences in entorhinal subregions of the human brain. Layer 2 of the rodent medial and the human caudal entorhinal cortex were structurally similar in that in both species patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal cells were superimposed on scattered stellate cells. The number of calbindin-positive neurons in a patch increased from \&\#x223C;80 in Etruscan shrews to \&\#x223C;800 in humans, only an \&\#x223C;10-fold over a 20,000-fold difference in brain size. The relatively constant size of calbindin patches differs from cortical modules such as barrels, which scale with brain size. Thus, selective pressure appears to conserve the distribution of stellate and pyramidal cells, periodic arrangement of calbindin patches, and relatively constant neuron number in calbindin patches in medial/caudal entorhinal cortex.},

  abstract = {Visual landmarks exert stimulus control over spatial behavior and the spatially tuned firing of place, head-direction, and grid cells in the rodent. However, the neural site of convergence for representations of landmarks and representations of space has yet to be identified. A potential site of plasticity underlying associations with landmarks is the postsubiculum. To test this, we blocked glutamatergic transmission in the rat postsubiculum with CNQX, or NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity with d-AP5. These infusions were sufficient to block evoked potentials from the lateral dorsal thalamus and long-term depression following tetanization of this input to the postsubiculum, respectively. In a second experiment, CNQX disrupted the stability of rat hippocampal place cell fields in a familiar environment. In a novel environment, blockade of plasticity with d-AP5 in the postsubiculum did not block the formation of a stable place field map following a 6 h delay. In a final behavioral experiment, postsubicular infusions of both compounds blocked object-location memory in the rat, but did not affect object recognition memory. These results suggest that the postsubiculum is necessary for the recognition of familiar environments, and that NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the postsubiculum is required for the formation of new object\textendash{}place associations that support recognition memory. However, plasticity in the postsubiculum is not necessary for the formation of new spatial maps.},

  abstract = {The presubiculum (PrS) is part of an interconnected network of distributed brain regions where individual neurons signal the animals heading direction. PrS sends axons to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), it is reciprocally connected with anterior thalamic nuclei (ATNs), and it sends feedback projections to the lateral mammillary nucleus (LMN), involved in generating the head direction signal. The intrinsic properties of projecting neurons will influence the pathway-specific transmission of activity. Here, we used projection-specific labeling of presubicular neurons to identify MEC-, LMN-, and ATN-projecting neurons in mice. MEC-projecting neurons located in superficial layers II/III were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons, and we also identified a Martinotti-type GABAergic neuron. The cell bodies of LMN-projecting neurons were located in a well-delimited area in the middle portion of the PrS, which corresponds to layer IV. The physiology of LMN projecting, pyramidal neurons stood out with a tendency to fire in bursts of action potentials (APs) with rapid onset. These properties may be uniquely adapted to reliably transmit visual landmark information with short latency to upstream LMN. Neurons projecting to ATN were located in layers V/VI, and they were mostly regular spiking pyramidal neurons. Unsupervised cluster analysis of intrinsic properties suggested distinct physiological features for the different categories of projection neurons, with some similarities between MEC- and ATN-projecting neurons. Projection-specific subpopulations may serve separate functions in the PrS and may be engaged differently in transmitting head direction related information.},

  abstract = {Layer 3 of the medial entorhinal cortex is a major gateway from the neocortex to the hippocampus. Here we addressed structure-function relationships in medial entorhinal cortex layer 3 by combining anatomical analysis with juxtacellular identification of single neurons in freely behaving rats. Anatomically, layer 3 appears as a relatively homogeneous cell sheet. Dual-retrograde neuronal tracing experiments indicate a large overlap between layer 3 pyramidal populations, which project to ipsilateral hippocampus, and the contralateral medial entorhinal cortex. These cells were intermingled within layer 3, and had similar morphological and intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Dendritic trees of layer 3 neurons largely avoided the calbindin-positive patches in layer 2. Identification of layer 3 neurons during spatial exploration (n = 17) and extracellular recordings (n = 52) pointed to homogeneous spatial discharge patterns. Layer 3 neurons showed only weak spiking theta rhythmicity and sparse head-direction selectivity. A majority of cells (50 of 69) showed no significant spatial modulation. All of the \&\#x223C;28\% of neurons that carried significant amounts of spatial information (19 of 69) discharged in irregular spatial patterns. Thus, layer 3 spatiotemporal firing properties are remarkably different from those of layer 2, where theta rhythmicity is prominent and spatially modulated cells often discharge in grid or border patterns. Significance statement: Neurons within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) often discharge in border, head-direction, and theta-modulated grid patterns. It is still largely unknown how defined discharge patterns relate to cellular diversity in the superficial layers of the MEC. In the present study, we addressed this issue by combining anatomical analysis with juxtacellular identification of single layer 3 neurons in freely behaving rats. We provide evidence that the anatomical organization and spatiotemporal firing properties of layer 3 neurons are remarkably different from those in layer 2. Specifically, most layer 3 neurons discharged in spatially irregular firing patterns, with weak theta-modulation and head-directional selectivity. This work thus poses constraints on the spatiotemporal patterns reaching downstream targets, like the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {The presubiculum provides a major input to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and contains cells that encode for the animal's head direction (HD), as well as other cells likely to be important for navigation and memory, including grid cells. To understand the mechanisms underlying HD cell firing and its effects on other parts of the circuit, it is important to determine the anatomical identity of these functionally defined cells. Therefore, we juxtacellularly recorded single cells in the presubiculum in freely moving rats, finding two classes of cells based on firing patterns and juxtacellular labeling (of a subset). Regular-firing cells had the anatomical characteristics of pyramidal cells and included most recorded HD cells. Therefore, HD cells are likely to be excitatory pyramidal cells. For one HD cell, we could follow an axon projecting directly to the MEC. Fast-spiking (FS) cells had the anatomical characteristics of interneurons and displayed weak HD tuning. Furthermore, FS cells displayed a surprising lack of theta-rhythmic firing, in strong contrast to the FS cells that we recorded in the MEC. Overall, we show that HD cells in the presubiculum are pyramidal cells, with FS interneurons only showing weak HD tuning; therefore, MEC may receive an excitatory HD input, as previously assumed by many models. The lack of theta rhythmicity in FS interneurons suggests that different mechanisms may underlie theta in different parts of the hippocampal formation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In freely moving rats, we recorded and labeled single neurons in the presubiculum, an area providing one of the major inputs to the medial entorhinal cortex and part of a network involved in spatial navigation and memory. Post hoc identification of labeled cells showed that (fast-spiking, FS) interneurons and pyramidal cells in the presubiculum can be distinguished based on physiological criteria. We found that both moderately and strongly tuned head-direction (HD) cells are pyramidal cells and therefore likely to provide an excitatory HD input to the entorhinal cortex. FS interneurons were weakly head directional and, surprisingly, showed no theta-rhythmic firing. Therefore, the presubiculum appears to encode HD information via excitatory pyramidal cells, possibly also involving FS interneurons, without using a theta-rhythmic temporal code.},

Layer 2 stellate cells showed stronger theta modulation than layer 3 neurons, and both fired during the ascending phase of field potential theta. Deep-layer neurons showed little or no activity. Layer 2 stellate cells resided in hundreds of small patches. At the dorsomedial entorhinal border, we identified larger (putative parasubicular) patches, which contained polarized head-direction selective neurons firing during the descending theta phase.

The mechanism of hippocampal remapping remains elusive but spatially modulated cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) have been identified as a possible contributor. Using pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches, we tested the role of MEC cells by examining in mice whether partial inactivation in MEC shifts hippocampal activity to a different subset of place cells with different receptive fields. The pharmacologically selective designer Gi-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor hM4D or the light-responsive microbial proton pump archaerhodopsin (ArchT) was expressed in MEC, and place cells were recorded after application of the inert ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or light at appropriate wavelengths. CNO or light caused partial inactivation of the MEC. The inactivation was followed by substantial remapping in the hippocampus, without disruption of the spatial firing properties of individual neurons. The results point to MEC input as an element of the mechanism for remapping in place cells.},

Better understanding of its functional diversity and complexity has led to an increased demand for specificity in experimental procedures and manipulations. In view of the complex 3D structure of the hippocampal region, precisely positioned experimental approaches require a fine-grained architectural description that is available and readable to experimentalists lacking detailed anatomical experience. In this paper, we provide the first cyto- and chemoarchitectural description of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region in the rat at high resolution and in the three standard sectional planes: coronal, horizontal and sagittal. The atlas uses a series of adjacent sections stained for neurons and for a number of chemical marker substances, particularly parvalbumin and calbindin. All the borders defined in one plane have been cross-checked against their counterparts in the other two planes.

The question of primary concern in the present research was whether the group of anatomically related structures (hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum/parasubiculum, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal/postrhinal cortex) are involved in mediating a similar memory process or whether the individual structures are differentially involved in memory processes and/or in handling various types of information. A series of five experiments were carried out that involved selectively lesioning the main MTL structures and testing each animal on radial-maze tasks and procedures that provided measures of two different memory processes (reference memory, working memory) and the utilization of two kinds of information (spatial, nonspatial). The structures were found to differ functionally, with the hippocampus and the presubiculum/parasubiculum being especially involved in processing spatial information, and the perirhinal/postrhinal cortex having a specific role in remembering information over a brief time period (working memory). Lesions of the entorhinal cortex failed to affect consistently either memory process or type of information handled, but they did result in impairments in learning the complex spatial discrimination requiring reference memory and in working memory involving nonspatial information. The pattern of behavioral impairments resulting from damage to these discrete MTL structures suggests that several of the structures make unique contributions to learning and memory.},

  abstract = {Principal neurons in different medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) layers show variations in spatial modulation that stabilize between 15 and 30 days postnatally. These in vivo variations are likely due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties and integrative capacities of neurons. The latter depends on inputs and thus potentially on the morphology of principal neurons. In this comprehensive study, we systematically compared the morphological and physiological characteristics of principal neurons in all MEC layers of newborn rats before and after weaning. We recorded simultaneously from up to four post-hoc morphologically identified MEC principal neurons in vitro. Neurons in L(ayer) I-LIII have dendritic and axonal arbors mainly in superficial layers, and LVI neurons mainly in deep layers. The dendritic and axonal trees of part of LV neurons diverge throughout all layers. Physiological properties of principal neurons differ between layers. In LII, most neurons have a prominent sag potential, resonance and membrane oscillations. Neurons in LIII and LVI fire relatively regular, and lack sag potentials and membrane oscillations. LV neurons show the most prominent spike-frequency adaptation and highest input resistance. The data indicate that adult-like principal neuron types can be differentiated early on during postnatal development. The results of the accompanying paper, in which principal neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) were described (Canto and Witter,2011), revealed that significant differences between LEC and MEC exist mainly in LII neurons. We therefore systematically analyzed changes in LII biophysical properties along the mediolateral axis of MEC and LEC. There is a gradient in properties typical for MEC LII neurons. These properties are most pronounced in medially located neurons and become less apparent in more laterally positioned ones. This gradient continues into LEC, such that in LEC medially positioned neurons share some properties with adjacent MEC cells. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Activity of the immediate early gene c-fos was compared across hemispheres in rats with unilateral fornix lesions. To engage Fos production, rats first performed a radial arm maze task that is severely disrupted by bilateral fornix lesions. Using immunohistochemical techniques, Fos-positive cells were visualized and counted in 39 sites in both hemispheres. Fornix lesions led to a significant reduction in Fos in all ipsilateral hippocampal subfields, as well as the entorhinal cortex and most of the subicular complex. Other sites that showed reduced activity included the ipsilateral retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and postrhinal cortices. Subcortical regions showing significant Fos decreases included the anterior thalamic nuclei, supramammillary nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, and lateral septum. Thus, the effects of fornix lesions extended beyond the hippocampal formation and included sites not directly innervated by the tract. These changes were nevertheless selective, as shown by the lack of hemispheric difference in any of the preselected control sites, the perirhinal cortex, or nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, there were no hemispheric differences in an additional group of animals with unilateral fornix lesions that were killed directly from the home cage. The location of Fos changes closely corresponded to those brain regions that when lesioned disrupt spatial working memory. Moreover, there was a correspondence between those brain regions that show increased Fos production in normal animals performing the radial arm maze task and those affected by fornix lesions. These results show that fornix transection has widespread, but selective, effects on a network of structures normally activated by spatial memory processes, with these effects extending beyond the hippocampal formation.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to relate the distribution of efferents of the dorsal subiculum to their origin along the proximodistal axis of the subiculum. The distribution of subicular projections was studied in detail by means of the sensitive anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), and the precise origin of these projections analysed with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers, using double- and triple-labelling protocols. Injections of PHA-L in the proximal part of the dorsal subiculum, i.e. that part which borders field CA1, result in labelling of the infralimbic, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, the nucleus accumbens and the lateral septal region, the interanteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, the core of the nucleus gelatinosus, and the mammillary nuclei, in particular in the rostral parts of the medial nucleus. In contrast, injections in the distal part of the dorsal subiculum, i.e. that part which borders the presubiculum, give rise to labelling in the retrosplenial and postrhinal cortices, the presubiculum, the anterior thalamic complex, the shell of the nucleus gelatinosus, and the mammillary nuclei, preferentially in the caudal part of the medial nucleus. The results of injections of different retrograde tracers, simultaneously placed in two or three targets of the subicular efferents, confirm the results of the anterograde tracing experiments. Moreover, they clearly demonstrate that the population of subicular neurons which, for example, projects to the nucleus accumbens and the interanteromedial nucleus of the thalamus is almost completely segregated from the population that projects to the retrosplenial cortex and the anterior complex of the thalamus. Thus within the dorsal subiculum, populations of neurons can be differentiated so that each population projects to a unique set of target structures. These cell populations are differentially positioned along the proximo-distal axis. In view of additional evidence indicating that some of the major afferents to the subiculum are organized along the same axis, we suggest that the heterogeneity of the dorsal subiculum along the proximo-distal axis reflects a general organizational characteristic of this hippocampal field.},

Second, the same grid cells that lost their grid fields acquired substantial tuning to the direction of the rat's head. This transition in firing properties was contingent on a drop in the average firing rate of the grid cells and could be replicated by the removal of an external excitatory drive in an attractor network model in which grid structure emerges by velocity-dependent translation of activity across a network with inhibitory connections. These results point to excitatory drive from the hippocampus, and possibly other regions, as one prerequisite for the formation and translocation of grid patterns in the MEC.},

  abstract = {Two neural systems are known to encode self-location in the brain: Place cells in the hippocampus encode unique locations in unique environments, whereas grid cells, border cells and head-direction cells in the parahippocampal cortex provide a universal metric for mapping positions and directions in all environments. These systems have traditionally been studied in very simple environments; however, natural environments are compartmentalized, nested and variable in time. Recent studies indicate that hippocampal and entorhinal spatial maps reflect this complexity. The maps fragment into interconnected, rapidly changing and tightly coordinated submaps. Plurality, fast dynamics and dynamic grouping are optimal for a brain system thought to exploit large pools of stored information to guide behavior on a second-by-second time frame in the animal's natural habitat.},

  abstract = {Automated analysis of MRI data of the subregions of the hippocampus requires computational atlases built at a higher resolution than those that are typically used in current neuroimaging studies. Here we describe the construction of a statistical atlas of the hippocampal formation at the subregion level using ultra-high resolution, ex vivo MRI. Fifteen autopsy samples were scanned at 0.13mm isotropic resolution (on average) using customized hardware. The images were manually segmented into 13 different hippocampal substructures using a protocol specifically designed for this study; precise delineations were made possible by the extraordinary resolution of the scans. In addition to the subregions, manual annotations for neighboring structures (e.g., amygdala, cortex) were obtained from a separate dataset of in vivo, T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole brain (1mm resolution). The manual labels from the in vivo and ex vivo data were combined into a single computational atlas of the hippocampal formation with a novel atlas building algorithm based on Bayesian inference. The resulting atlas can be used to automatically segment the hippocampal subregions in structural MRI images, using an algorithm that can analyze multimodal data and adapt to variations in MRI contrast due to differences in acquisition hardware or pulse sequences. The applicability of the atlas, which we are releasing as part of FreeSurfer (version 6.0), is demonstrated with experiments on three different publicly available datasets with different types of MRI contrast. The results show that the atlas and companion segmentation method: 1) can segment T1 and T2 images, as well as their combination, 2) replicate findings on mild cognitive impairment based on high-resolution T2 data, and 3) can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease subjects and elderly controls with 88\% accuracy in standard resolution (1mm) T1 data, significantly outperforming the atlas in FreeSurfer version 5.3 (86\% accuracy) and classification based on whole hippocampal volume (82\% accuracy).},

  issn = {0306-4522},
  abstract = {The entorhinal cortex and other hippocampal and parahippocampal cortices are interconnected by a small number of GABAergic nonpyramidal neurons in addition to glutamatergic pyramidal cells. Since the cortical and basolateral amygdalar nuclei have cortex-like cell types and have robust projections to the entorhinal cortex, we hypothesized that a small number of amygdalar GABAergic nonpyramidal neurons might participate in amygdalo-entorhinal projections. To test this hypothesis we combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for the amygdalar nonpyramidal cell markers glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M2R). Injections of FG into the rat entorhinal cortex labeled numerous neurons that were mainly located in the cortical and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. Although most of these amygdalar FG+ neurons labeled by entorhinal injections were large pyramidal cells, 1-5\% were smaller long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) that expressed SOM, or both SOM and NPY. No amygdalar FG+ neurons in these cases were PV+ or VIP+. Cell counts revealed that LRNP neurons labeled by injections into the entorhinal cortex constituted about 10-20\% of the total SOM+ population, and 20-40\% of the total NPY population in portions of the lateral amygdalar nucleus that exhibited a high density of FG+ neurons. Sixty-two percent of amygdalar FG+/SOM+ neurons were GAD+, and 51\% were M2R+. Since GABAergic projection neurons typically have low perikaryal levels of GABAergic markers, it is actually possible that most or all of the amygdalar LRNP neurons are GABAergic. Like GABAergic LRNP neurons in hippocampal/parahippocampal regions, amygdalar LRNP neurons that project to the entorhinal cortex are most likely involved in synchronizing oscillatory activity between the two regions. These oscillations could entrain synchronous firing of amygdalar and entorhinal pyramidal neurons, thus facilitating functional interactions between them, including synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {The organization of the laminar and topographical projections from the presubiculum to the entorhinal area was studied in the rat by anterograde labeling with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin. We found that the pattern of presubiculo-entorhinal projections differs between the superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum. The superficial layers (layers II and III) of the presubiculum gave rise to bilateral projections to layers I\textendash{}VI of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Many terminals were distributed in layer III, fewer in layer II and the deep portion of layer I, and many fewer terminals in the deep layers (layers V and VI) of MEA. In contrast, the deep layers (layers V and VI) of the presubiculum gave rise to ipsilateral projections to the entorhinal area. Many axon terminals were distributed in layers V and VI of MEA and the most superficial portion of layer I of MEA, but very few in layers II and III. In addition, the ramifications in layer I extended to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA). Using two-dimensional unfolded maps of parahippocampal cortices, we elucidated the distinct topographical relationship in the presubiculo-entorhinal projection: 1) The septotemporal or longitudinal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis on the MEA/LEA boundary, where the septal presubiculum projected toward the rhinal fissure and the temporal presubiculum projected away from the fissure. 2) The proximodistal axis of the presubiculum corresponded to the axis from the MEA/LEA boundary to the MEA/parasubiculum boundary that was virtually perpendicular to the MEA/LEA boundary, where the proximal portion of the presubiculum (close to the subiculum) projected to the region near the MEA/LEA boundary.

  abstract = {The enormous potential of modern molecular neuroanatomical tools lies in their ability to determine the precise connectivity of the neuronal cell types comprising the innate circuitry of the brain. We used transgenically targeted viral tracing to identify the monosynaptic inputs to the projection neurons of layer II of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC-LII) in mice. These neurons are not only major inputs to the hippocampus, the structure most clearly implicated in learning and memory, they also are ``grid cells.'' Here we address the question of what kinds of inputs are specifically targeting these MEC-LII cells. Cell-specific infection of MEC-LII with recombinant rabies virus results in unambiguous labeling of monosynaptic inputs. Furthermore, ratios of labeled neurons in different regions are largely consistent between animals, suggesting that label reflects density of innervation. While the results mostly confirm prior anatomical work, they also reveal a novel major direct input to MEC-LII from hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, the vast majority of these direct hippocampal inputs arise not from the major hippocampal subfields of CA1 and CA3, but from area CA2, a region that has historically been thought to merely be a transitional zone between CA3 and CA1. We confirmed this unexpected result using conventional tracing techniques in both rats and mice.},

  abstract = {The brain has an extraordinary ability to create an internal spatial map of the external world [1]. This map-like representation of environmental surroundings is encoded through specific types of neurons, located within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which exhibit spatially tuned firing patterns [2, 3]. In addition to encoding space, these neurons are believed to be related to contextual information and memory [4\textendash{}7]. One class of such cells is the grid cells, which are located within the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum [3, 8]. Grid cell firing forms a hexagonal array of firing fields, a pattern that is largely thought to reflect the operation of intrinsic self-motion-related computations [9\textendash{}12]. If this is the case, then fields should be relatively uniform in size, number of spikes, and peak firing rate. However, it has been suggested that this is not in fact the case [3, 13]. The possibility exists that local spatial information also influences grid cells, which\textemdash{}if true\textemdash{}would greatly change the way in which grid cells are thought to contribute to place coding. Accordingly, we asked how discriminable the individual fields of a given grid cell are by looking at the distribution of field firing rates and reproducibility of this distribution across trials. Grid fields were less uniform in intensity than expected, and the pattern of strong and weak fields was spatially stable and recurred across trials. The distribution remained unchanged even after arena rescaling, but not after remapping. This suggests that additional local information is being overlaid onto the global hexagonal pattern of grid cells.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the coding region of the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, a rare multisystem neurodegenerative disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients with Wolfram syndrome display considerable clinical pleiomorphism, and symptoms such as neurological complications and psychiatric disorders are common. In the present study we have characterized Wfs1 expression pattern in the mouse central nervous system by using a combination of immunohistochemistry on wild-type mice and X-Gal staining of Wfs1 knockout mice with targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter. We identified a robust enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala and ventral striatum. Prominent Wfs1 expression was seen in the hippocampal CA1 region, parasubiculum, superficial part of the second and third layers of the prefrontal cortex and proisocortical areas, hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory system, and central auditory pathway. Wfs1 expression was also detected in numerous brainstem nuclei and in laminae VIII and IX of the spinal cord. Wfs1-positive nerve fibers were found in the medial forebrain bundle, reticular part of the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, posterior caudate putamen, lateral lemniscus, alveus, fimbria, dorsal hippocampal commissure, subiculum, and to a lesser extent in the central sublenticular extended amygdala, compact part of substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. The neuroanatomical findings suggest that the lack of Wfs1 protein function can be related to several neurological and psychiatric symptoms found in Wolfram syndrome. Enrichment of Wfs1 protein in the central extended amygdala suggests a role in the modulation of anxiety and fear. J. Comp.

Principal cells in all layers of MEC show signs of directional tuning, overt in head direction cells present in all layers except for layer II, and covert in grid cells, which are the major spatially modulated cell type in layer II. Directional information likely originates in the head direction-vestibular system and PrS and PaS are thought to provide this information to MEC. Efferents from PaS and PrS show a selective laminar terminal distribution in MEC superficial layers II and III, respectively. We hypothesized that this anatomically determined laminar distribution does not preclude monosynaptic interaction with neurons located in deeper layers of MEC in view of the extensive apical dendrites from deeper cells reaching layers II and III. This hypothesis was tested in the rat using tilted in vitro slices in which origins and terminations of PrS and PaS fibers were maintained, as assessed using anterograde anatomical tracing. Based on voltage-sensitive dye imaging, multipatch single-cell recordings, and scanning photostimulation of caged glutamate, we report first that principal neurons in all layers of MEC receive convergent monosynaptic inputs from PrS and PaS and second, that elicited responses show layer-specific decay times and frequency-dependent facilitation. These results indicate that regardless of their selective laminar terminal distribution, PrS and PaS inputs may monosynaptically convey directional information to principal neurons in all layers of MEC through synapses on their extensive dendritic arbors.},

We investigated changes in the expression of 10 major GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in subfields of the ventral hippocampus, ventral subiculum, EC, and perirhinal cortex (PRC) at different intervals (1, 8, 30, and 90 days) after kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus priming epileptogenesis in the rat. The most pronounced and ubiquitous changes were a transient (24 h after KA only) down-regulation of \&\#x3B3;2 mRNA and lasting decreases in subunit \&\#x3B1;5, \&\#x3B2;3, and \&\#x3B4; mRNAs that were prominent in all hippocampal and parahippocampal areas. In the subiculum similarly as in sectors CA1 and CA3, levels of subunit \&\#x3B1;1, \&\#x3B1;2, \&\#x3B1;4, and \&\#x3B3;2 mRNAs decreased transiently (1 day after KA-induced status epilepticus). They were followed by increased expression of subunit \&\#x3B1;1 and \&\#x3B1;3 mRNAs in the dentate gyrus (DG) and sectors CA1 and CA3, and subunit \&\#x3B1;1 also in the EC layer II (30 and 90 days after KA). We also observed sustained overexpression of subunits \&\#x3B1;4 and \&\#x3B3;2 in the subiculum and in the Ammon's horn. Subunit \&\#x3B3;2 mRNA was also increased in sector CA1 at the late intervals after KA. Taken together, our results suggest distinct regulation of mRNA expression for individual GABAA receptor subunits. Especially striking was the wide-spread down-regulation of the often peri- or extrasynaptically located subunits \&\#x3B1;5 and \&\#x3B4;. These subunits are often associated with tonic inhibition. Their decrease could be related to decreased tonic inhibition or may merely reflect compensatory changes. In contrast, expression of subunit \&\#x3B1;4 that may also mediate tonic inhibition when associated with the \&\#x3B4;-subunit was significantly upregulated in the DG and in the proximal subiculum at late intervals. Thus, concomitant up-regulation of subunit \&\#x3B3;2, \&\#x3B1;1 and \&\#x3B1;4 mRNAs (and loss in \&\#x3B4;-subunits) ultimately indicates significant rearrangement of GABAA receptor composition after KA-induced seizures.},

  abstract = {The parahippocampal region, which comprises the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices, as well as the pre- and parasubiculum, receives inputs from several association cortices and provides the major cortical input to the hippocampus. This study examined the topographic organization of projections from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to the parahippocampal region in rats by injecting anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), into four subdivisions of OFC. The rostral portion of the perirhinal cortex receives strong projections from the medial (MO), ventral (VO), and ventrolateral (VLO) orbitofrontal areas and the caudal portion of lateral orbitofrontal area (LO). These projections terminate in the dorsal bank and fundus of the rhinal sulcus. In contrast, the postrhinal cortex receives a strong projection specifically from VO. All four subdivisions of OFC give rise to projections to the dorsolateral parts of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), preferentially distributing to more caudal levels of LEC. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) receives moderate input from VO and weak projections from MO, VLO, and LO. The presubiculum receives strong projections from caudal VO but only weak projections from other OFC regions. As for the laminar distribution of projections, axons originating from OFC terminate more densely in upper layers (layers I-III) than in deep layers in the parahippocampal region. These results thus show a striking topographic organization of OFC-to-parahippocampal connectivity. Whereas LO, VLO, VO, and MO interact with perirhinal-LEC circuits, the interactions with postrhinal cortex, presubiculum, and MEC are mediated predominantly through the projections of VO.},

On the test day, one group was moved so that both groups now performed the same radial-maze task in the same room but for one group the extramaze cues were novel. There were significant increases in Fos in all three of the anterior thalamic nuclei (anterodorsal, anteroventral and anteromedial) as well as the adjacent nucleus reuniens and rostral reticular thalamic nucleus, in both the eight-arm versus one-arm condition (Experiment 1) and the novel room versus familiar room condition (Experiment 2). There were no significant differences in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in either experiment. The more spatially demanding task in each experiment also resulted in increased Fos expression in the subicular complex (postsubiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum), as well as in the prelimbic cortex. Performing the standard radial-arm maze task also produced significant Fos increases in both rostral and caudal levels of the retrosplenial cortex when compared to rats running up and down a single arm in the same maze (Experiment 1); performing the task in a novel room did not, however, result in any further Fos increases in this region (Experiment 2). The specificity of the changes in levels of Fos was shown by a lack of any consistent difference in levels in six control sites.The present results reveal a group of anatomically related structures that work together in the intact rat brain during tasks that tax allocentric spatial working memory.},

  abstract = {Temporal coordination of neuronal assemblies among cortical areas is essential for behavioral performance. GABAergic projections from the medial septum and diagonal band complex exclusively innervate GABAergic interneurons in the rat hippocampus, contributing to the coordination of neuronal activity, including the generation of theta oscillations. Much less is known about the synaptic target neurons outside the hippocampus. To reveal the contribution of synaptic circuits involving the medial septum of mice, we have identified postsynaptic cortical neurons in wild-type and parvalbumin-Cre knock-in mice. Anterograde axonal tracing from the septum revealed extensive innervation of the hippocampus as well as the subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, and the retrosplenial cortex. In all examined cortical regions, many septal GABAergic boutons were in close apposition to somata or dendrites immunopositive for interneuron cell-type molecular markers, such as parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 1, cholecystokinin, reelin, or a combination of these molecules. Electron microscopic observations revealed septal boutons forming axosomatic or axodendritic type II synapses. In the CA1 region of hippocampus, septal GABAergic projections exclusively targeted interneurons. In the retrosplenial cortex, 93\% of identified postsynaptic targets belonged to interneurons and the rest to pyramidal cells. These results suggest that the GABAergic innervation from the medial septum and diagonal band complex contributes to temporal coordination of neuronal activity via several types of cortical GABAergic interneurons in both hippocampal and extrahippocampal cortices. Oscillatory septal neuronal firing at delta, theta, and gamma frequencies may phase interneuron activity.},

  abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the major input and output structure of the hippocampal formation, forming the nodal point in cortico-hippocampal circuits. Different division schemes including two or many more subdivisions have been proposed, but here we will argue that subdividing EC into two components, the lateral EC (LEC) and medial EC (MEC) might suffice to describe the functional architecture of EC. This subdivision then leads to an anatomical interpretation of the different phenotypes of LEC and MEC. First, we will briefly summarize the cytoarchitectonic differences and differences in hippocampal projection patterns on which the subdivision between LEC and MEC traditionally is based and provide a short comparative perspective. Second, we focus on main differences in cortical connectivity, leading to the conclusion that the apparent differences may well correlate with the functional differences. Cortical connectivity of MEC is features interactions with areas such as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and postrhinal cortex, all areas that are considered to belong to the "spatial processing domain" of the cortex. In contrast, LEC is strongly connected with olfactory areas, insular, medial- and orbitofrontal areas and perirhinal cortex. These areas are likely more involved in processing of object information, attention and motivation. Third, we will compare the intrinsic networks involving principal- and inter-neurons in LEC and MEC. Together, these observations suggest that the different phenotypes of both EC subdivisions likely depend on the combination of intrinsic organization and specific sets of inputs. We further suggest a reappraisal of the notion of EC as a layered input-output structure for the hippocampal formation.},

  abstract = {In the present study we describe the characteristics of the chandelier cells in the rat entorhinal cortex and subicular complex by using the Golgi method and combined Golgi-electron microscopic techniques. In the entorhinal cortex, chandelier cells were frequently stained in layers II/III. Two types of axonal complexes were noted. One had a preferential horizontal orientation and gave rise to terminals located in the upper portion of layers II/III. The second type of chandelier cell axon was observed in the medial entorhinal area, innervating the entire extent of layers II/III. In the subicular complex, chandelier cells were frequently stained in the parasubiculum, whereas only a few cells were found in the presubiculum. In both subfields, chandelier cell axons were restricted to layers II/III. In the subiculum, most chandelier cells were present in the stratum radiatum, giving rise to a descending axon that branched in the stratum pyramidale. Both the size and morphological features of the chandelier cell terminal portions were found to be region-specific. Electron microscopically, the cell body and dendrites of gold-toned chandelier cells displayed typical features of nonpyramidal cells, such as the presence of nuclear infoldings, symmetric and asymmetric synapses on the cell body, and moderate numbers of axon terminals covering the smooth dendritic surface. Five gold-toned chandelier cell axonal complexes were analyzed at the fine structural level. In all parahippocampal regions, gold-labeled axon terminals formed symmetric contacts with axon initial segments. Our results demonstrate the presence, morphological characteristics, and target selectivity of identified chandelier cells in the parahippocampal region of the rat. Together with previous data, these results suggest a wide distribution of this specialized type of cortical interneuron and indicate that it is a constant and essential component of inhibitory circuits in the cerebral cortex. The possible significance of chandelier cells for the circuits linking several subfields of the hippocampal formation is discussed. \textcopyright{} 1993 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

Analysis of the PHAL injections that were relatively well restricted to single layers of the MEA reveals very sparse projections to the parasubiculum, presubiculum, and subiculum, while numerous projections within the MEA are found. The course and the termination of the intra-entorhinal projections differ depending upon the particular layer under study, and marked differences are found between the deep and the superficial layers in terms of the divergence of their respective projections. However, the general intra-entorhinal orientation of these projections is essentially the same for all layers: longitudinal with a slightly oblique course, such that at ventral levels the center of a particular terminal field is always located lateral -to the center of the respective PHA-L injection. PHA-L injections into layer II label axons running horizontally within this layer as well as within the deep part of layer I, and PHA-L injections into the medial sector of layer II reveal horizontal projections that innervate most of the second layer. The horizontal projections of layer III are more restricted than those of layer II but both layer U and III have prominent longitudinal projections directed ventrally. From layers II and III, numerous axons project to the deep layers (IV-VI) probably en route to extra-entorhinal structures, since no major terminal fields were detected in the deep layers. The PHA-L and the FB experiments show that the deep layers (in particular IV and VI) have far more divergent intra-entorhinal projections than have layers II and III. PHA-L injections into layers IV, V, and VI reveal widespread efferent projections to all of the more superficially located layers of the MEA in addition to projections to the Iateral EA. The retrograde transport studies show that layers IV and VI are the major sources of these divergent projections and that cells situated throughout the entire medial to lateral width of these layers project to every sector of the retrohippocampal region. Taken together, the findings of the present experiments suggest that (1) all layers of the MEA have longitudinal projections, directed primarily toward the ventral (or temporal) part of this cortex, (2) the projections of layers II and III are relatively restricted compared of the deeper layers, and (3) the deep layers (in particular IV and VI) have highly divergent projections such that they reach most parts of layers II and III throughout the longitudinal axis of the MEA, in addition to their innervations of the lateral EA and to some degree the para- and presubiculum.},

This information represents an important component of episodic memory, mediated by the parahippocampal-hippocampal region. A comprehensive description of insular projections to the latter region is lacking. Previous studies reported that insular projections do not target any of the subdivisions in the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyus, the cornu ammonis [CA] fields 1, 2, and 3 and the subiculum), but, in contrast, target the parahippocampal region (perirhinal, postrhinal, lateral and medial entorhinal cortices, and pre- and parasubiculum). The present study examined the topographical and laminar organization of insular projections to the parahippocampal region in the rat with the use of anterograde tracing. Notably, our results corroborated the absence of hippocampal projections. We further showed that the perirhinal and the lateral entorhinal cortices received extensive projections from the insular cortex, primarily from its agranular areas. With the exception of a weak projection to the postrhinal cortex, projections to the remaining parahippocampal areas were either absent or very sparse. The projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex displayed a preference for the deep layers of its most lateral subdivisions, known also to receive hippocampal inputs. Projections to the perirhinal cortex primarily targeted the superficial layers with a preference for its ventral subdivision, referred to as area 35. Our findings indicate that only processed information, reflecting emotional and affective states, but not primary gustatory and viscerosensory information, has direct access to the parahippocampal-hippocampal system.},

The hippocampal and parahippocampal region and the retrosplenial cortex are crucially involved in navigational processes and connections between the parahippocampal/retrosplenial domain and the posterior parietal cortex have been described. However, an integrated account of the organization of these connections is lacking. Here, we investigated parahippocampal connections of each posterior parietal subdivision and the neighboring secondary visual cortex using conventional retrograde and anterograde tracers as well as transsynaptic retrograde tracing with a modified rabies virus. The results show that posterior parietal as well as secondary visual cortex entertain overall sparse connections with the parahippocampal region but not with the hippocampal formation. The medial and lateral dorsal subdivisions of posterior parietal cortex receive sparse input from deep layers of all parahippocampal areas. Conversely, all posterior parietal subdivisions project moderately to dorsal presubiculum, whereas rostral perirhinal cortex, postrhinal cortex, caudal entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum all receive sparse posterior parietal input. This indicated that the presubiculum might be a major liaison between parietal and parahippocampal domains. In view of the close association of the presubiculum with the retrosplenial cortex, we included the latter in our analysis. Our data indicate that posterior parietal cortex is moderately connected with the retrosplenial cortex, particularly with rostral area 30. The relative sparseness of the connectivity with the parahippocampal and retrosplenial domains suggests that posterior parietal cortex is only a modest actor in forming spatial representations underlying navigation and spatial memory in parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortex. \&\#xA9; 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This syndrome has been attributed to mutations in the WFS1 gene. In this study, we made a detailed histochemical analysis of the distribution of Wfs1 mRNA in the brain of developing mice. There were three patterns of change in the strength of Wfs1 mRNA signals from birth to early adulthood. In type 1, the signals were weak or absent in neonates but strong or moderate in young adults. This pattern was observed in the CA1 field, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. In type 2, the signals were of a relatively constant strength during development. This pattern was seen in limbic structures (e.g. subiculum and central amygdaloid nucleus) and brainstem nuclei (e.g. facial and chochlear nuclei). In type 3, the signals peaked in the second week of age. This pattern was observed in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Thus, Wfs1 mRNA was widely distributed in the normal mouse brain during postnatal development. This evidence may provide clues as to the physiological role of the Wfs1 gene in the central nervous system, and help to explain endocrinological, otological, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms in Wolfram syndrome patients.},

In the transverse plane, most of the cortical projection cells were vertically located in the middle region of the subicular pyramidal cell layer. The cells giving rise to the projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex were predominantly located in the most proximal (near CA1), superficial region. Few cortical projection cells were located in the deepest (adjacent to the angular bundle) region. The distribution of cortical projection cells showed an oblique tri-laminar pattern, which was similar to the previously reported laminal pattern of subcortical projection cells in the subiculum. These results suggest that cortical projection cells in middle and superficial regions of the subiculum may correspond to layer V of the isocortex and cells in the deepest region corresponding to layer VI.},

Basic properties of this map are present when rat pups explore the world outside of their nest for the first time, around postnatal day 16-18 (P16-P18). One of the first functions to be expressed in navigating animals is the directional tuning of the head direction cells. To determine whether head direction tuning is expressed at even earlier ages, before the start of exploration, and to establish whether vision is necessary for the development of directional tuning, we recorded neural activity in pre- and parasubiculum, or medial entorhinal cortex, from P11 onward, 3-4 days before the eyelids unseal. Head direction cells were present from the first day of recording. Firing rates were lower than in adults, and preferred firing directions were less stable, drifting within trials and changing completely between trials. Yet the cells drifted coherently, i.e., relative firing directions were maintained from one trial to the next. Directional tuning stabilized shortly after eye opening. The data point to a hardwired attractor network for representation of head direction in which directional tuning develops before vision and visual input serves primarily to anchor firing direction to the external world.},

  abstract = {Voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels in the CNS are involved in regulation of subthreshold membrane potentials, and thus reception and integration of synaptic signals. Although such features are particularly important for induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, relatively little is known about their subcellular localization. Here we analyzed the detailed distribution of Kv4.2 potassium channels in the mouse hippocampal region using confocal and electron microscopy. At the light microscopic level, the Kv4.2 immunoreactivity occurred in a punctate fashion in the whole area of the hippocampal region. In the hippocampus proper, most of the Kv4.2-positive puncta were small, and they were abundant at the dendritic compartments of pyramidal neurons. High-resolution confocal microscopy revealed that there was no apparent association between Kv4.2-positive puncta with major synaptic markers, such as vesicular glutamate transporters and glutamic acid decarboxylase. In the subicular complex and dentate gyrus, we encountered large distinct Kv4.2-positive puncta at the perimeter of somata and proximal dendrites of principal cells. These puncta were often in contact with glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive boutons, but showed no apparent association with vesicular glutamate transporters. The glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive boutons apposing to Kv4.2-positive puncta were parvalbumin-positive. Quantitative image analysis showed that approximately half of Kv4.2-positive puncta were closely apposed to glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive boutons in the parasubiculum and dentate gyrus. Electron microscopic examination substantiated the presence of large Kv4.2-positive patches at postsynaptic sites of symmetric synapses and small patches at extrasynaptic sites. No presynaptic terminals were labeled. The present findings indicate targeted clustering of Kv4.2 potassium channels at postsynaptic sites of GABAergic synapses and extrasynaptic sites, and provide some key to understand their role in the hippocampal region.},

Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, we investigated plastic morphologic and neurochemical changes in parahippocampal neurons in the kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Although constitutively contained in similar subclasses of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons, both neuropeptide systems undergo distinctly different changes in their expression. Somatostatin messenger RNA (mRNA) is rapidly but transiently expressed de novo in pyramidal neurons of the subiculum and entorhinal cortex 24 hours after KA. Surviving somatostatin interneurons display increased mRNA levels at late intervals (3 months) after KA and increased labeling of their terminals in the outer molecular layer of the subiculum; the labeling correlates with the number of spontaneous seizures, suggesting that the seizures may trigger somatostatin expression. In contrast, neuropeptide Y mRNA is consistently expressed in principal neurons of the proximal subiculum and the lateral entorhinal cortex and labeling for the peptide persistently increased in virtually all major excitatory pathways of the hippocampal formation. The pronounced plastic changes differentially involving both neuropeptide systems indicate marked rearrangement of parahippocampal areas, presumably aiming at endogenous seizure protection.

Using polarized light microscopy at 1.3 \&\#xB5;m resolution, we have directly visualized the 3D course of key medial temporal pathways in 3 ex vivo human hemispheres and 2 ex vivo vervet monkey hemispheres. The multiple components of the perforant path system were clearly identified: Superficial sheets of fibers emanating from the entorhinal cortex project to the presubiculum and parasubiculum, intermixed transverse and longitudinal angular bundle fibers perforate the subiculum and then project to the cornu ammonis (CA) fields and dentate molecular layer, and a significant alvear component runs from the angular bundle to the CA fields. From the hilus, mossy fibers localize to regions of high kainate receptor density, and the endfolial pathway, mostly investigated in humans, merges with the Schaffer collaterals. This work defines human hippocampal pathways underlying mnemonic function at an unprecedented resolution.},

Head-direction cells in the pre- and parasubiculum have adultlike properties from the beginning. Place and grid cells are also present but evolve more gradually. Grid cells show the slowest development. The gradual refinement of the spatial representation is accompanied by an increase in network synchrony among entorhinal stellate cells.

Hippocampal ``place'' cells, fire selectively when an animal is in a particular location within the environment. It is thought that this activity underlies a representation of the environment that can be used for memory-based spatial navigation. But how is this representation constructed and how is it ``read''? A simple mechanism, based on place field density across an environment, is described that could allow hippocampal representations to be ``read'' by other brain regions for the purpose of navigation. The possible influence of activity in neighboring brain regions such as the perirhinal cortex, and pre- and para-subiculum on the construction of the hippocampal spatial representation is then discussed. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Blockade of ionotropic glutamate and GABA synaptic transmission did not reduce the power of the oscillations, indicating that oscillations are not dependent on synaptic inputs. Oscillations were eliminated when cells were hyperpolarized 6\textendash{}10 mV below spike threshold, indicating that they are mediated by voltage-dependent conductances. Application of TTX completely eliminated oscillations, suggesting that Na+ currents are required for the generation of the oscillations. Oscillations were not reduced by blocking Ca2+ currents with Cd2+ or Ca2+-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid, or by blocking K+ conductances with either 50 {$\mu$}M or 5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 30 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA), or Ba2+(1\textendash{}2 mM). Oscillations also persisted during blockade of the muscarinic-dependent K+ current, IM, using the selective antagonist XE-991 (10 {$\mu$}M). However, oscillations were significantly attenuated by blocking the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current Ih with Cs+ and were almost completely blocked by the more potent Ih blocker ZD7288 (100 {$\mu$}M). Intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in neurons of layer II of the parasubiculum are therefore likely driven by an interaction between an inward persistent Na+ current and time-dependent deactivation of Ih. These voltage-dependent conductances provide a mechanism for the generation of membrane potential oscillations that can help support rhythmic network activity within the parasubiculum during theta-related behaviors.},

While the subdivisions of hippocampus proper form more or less continuous cell sheets, the superficial layers of the parahippocampal region have a distinct modular architecture. We investigate the spatial distribution, laminar position, and putative connectivity of zinc-positive modules in layer 2 of the MEC of rats and relate them to the calbindin-positive patches previously described in the entorhinal cortex. We found that the zinc-positive modules are complementary to the previously described calbindin-positive patches. We also found that inputs from the presubiculum are directed toward the zinc-positive modules while the calbindin-positive patches received inputs from the parasubiculum. Notably, the dendrites of neurons from layers 3 and 5, positive for Purkinje Cell Protein 4 expression, overlap with the zinc modules. Our data thus indicate that these two complementary modular systems, the calbindin patches and zinc modules, are part of parallel information streams in the hippocampal formation.},

  abstract = {The subicular\textendash{}parahippocampal projection has been proposed as the major output pathway of the hippocampus. This projection shows a striking topographic organization along its three-dimensional axes. Here we aimed to study the development of this projection system. We found that an adult-like topography of subiculum-to-parahippocampal projections is present by postnatal day 7 (P7). The cellular morphology in the subiculum is immature at this age, reaching maturity by P15\textendash{}19. The density of projections increases from P7 to P15\textendash{}19 but does so within the constraints of the adult topography. Projections to the entorhinal cortex show a clear arrangement in line with the adult data, in that distal portions of the subiculum project to the medial entorhinal cortex, whereas proximal portions project to the lateral entorhinal cortex. Our results add new details to the proximodistal organization of projections to the pre- and parasubiculum. We show that these projections arise exclusively from the more distal part, sharing their origin with that of medial entorhinal projections. Within this distal portion of the subiculum, a proximodistal gradient of origin maps onto a presubicular termination gradient starting in proximal presubiculum and extending gradually until it covers the proximodistal extent. Proximally located neurons in the distal part of the subiculum target the distal portion of the parasubiculum, and distal subicular neurons target the proximal most portion of parasubiculum. Given the specificity of the known topographic projections this early in development, we expect that these newly described topographic features will be maintained in the adult. J. Comp.

  issn = {0006-8993},
  abstract = {The hippocampal formation contributes importantly to many cognitive functions, and therefore has been a focus of intense anatomical and physiological research. Most of this research has focused on the hippocampus proper and the fascia dentata, and much less attention has been given to the subicular cortex, the origin of most extrinsic projections from the hippocampal formation. The present experiments demonstrate that the postsubiculum is a distinct area of the subicular cortex. The major projections to the postsubiculum originate in the hippocampal formation, the cingulate cortex, and the thalamus (primarily from the anterodorsal (AD) nucleus and to a lesser extent from the anteroventral (AV) and lateral dorsal (LD) nuclei). These projections differ from the thalamic projections to presubiculum and parasubiculum. Efferent projections from the postsubiculum terminate in both cortical and subcortical areas. The cortical projections terminate in the subicular and retrosplenial cortices and in the caudal lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Subcortical projections primarily end in the AD and the LD nuclei of the thalamus. These thalamic projections end in areas that are distinct from those to which the presubiculum and parasubiculum project. For instance, the postsubiculum has a dense terminal field in the AD nucleus, but presubicular axons terminate predominantly in the AV nucleus. The cortical projections also distinguish postsubiculum. All subicular areas project to the entorhinal cortex, but the postsubicular projection ends in the deep layers (i.e. IV-VI), whereas presubiculum projects to layers I and III, and parasubiculum projects to layer II. Postsubiculum projects to retrosplenial granular b cortex and only incidentally to retrosplenial granular a cortex. In contrast presubiculum projects to the retrosplenial granular a cortex but not to the retrosplenial granular b cortex. These differences clearly mark the postsubiculum, the presubiculum, and the parasubiculum as distinct regions within the subicular cortex and suggest that they subserve different roles in the processing and integration of limbic system information.},

  issn = {1096-9861},
  abstract = {The intrahippocampal projections of the subicular complex were studied in the rat with the aid of the anterogradely transported lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). After iontophoretic injections of the lectin into the subiculum proper, presubiculum, or the parasubiculum, axons and terminal processes immunoreactive for PHA-L were traced to their respective terminal fields within the hippocampal region. After subicular injections PHA-L-stained axons could be followed both in a caudal and a rostral direction. The caudally directed fibers course around or within the angular bundle to enter layers VI and V of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Many fibers penetrate through these layers to terminate in layer IV of the medial and the lateral entorhinal area, which contains a major terminal field of this projection. At more ventral levels, all layers of the entorhinal area are innervated by cells located in the subiculum. Other retrohippocampal projections of the subiculum proper include the deep and the outer two layers of the presubiculum and the medial sector of the parasubiculum, in addition to a massive projection which terminates in the retrosplenial cortex. The rostrally directed projections from the subiculum form a dense innervation of strata lacunosum, radiatum, oriens, and of individual pyramidal cells in the regio superior of the Ammon's horn. All these projections of the subiculum are exclusively ipsilateral. After injections of PHA-L into layers n and III of the presubiculum, both ipsi- and contralateral projections were traced to the outer three layers of the medial entorhinal area; the lateral entorhinal area apparently receives no innervation from the presubiculum. The innervation of layer III is very dense while in layer II and deep layer I, restricted zones of innervation are found. The fibers reach these layers via the deep layers of the MEA and through the molecular layer after first coursing around the parasubiculum. In addition, a minor projection from the presubiculum to the pyramidal cell layer of the subiculum and to the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation was found. PHA-L injections into the parasubiculum labeled fibers that form a dense innervation of layer II in the MEA and the medial part of the lateral EA, and of the most medial sector of layer III in the MEA. Layer I and the superficial part of layer II of the contralateral MEA also contain a dense terminal network after PHA-L injections into the parasubiculum. The commissural fibers reach the contralateral side via the dorsal hippocampal commissural system, the angular bundle, and finally through all layers of the contralateral EA. With the exception of a small projection to the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation, the parasubiculum appears not to innervate any of the other hippocampal subfields. Taken together, these studies have shown that each field of the subicular complex has projections restricted to separate layers of the entorhinal area, and thus, that each field participates in its own unique way in the control of entorhinal function.},

  abstract = {1. The presubiculum and parasubiculum are retrohippocampal structures bordered by the subiculum and medial entorhinal cortex. Deep layer (IV-VI) neurons from this region exhibit stable synaptically triggered burst behaviour which distinguishes them from superficial layer (I-III) cells. This functional separation was examined with intracellular and field potential recordings from horizontal slices of rat brain. Neurobiotin labelling and rapid Golgi techniques were used to obtain anatomical evidence of axonal trajectories. 2. Extracellular stimulation of the subiculum, deep medial entorhinal cortex or superficial pre- or parasubiculum caused, in deep layer cells only, a short latency burst discharge which could be followed by one or more after-discharges. Bursts appeared after repetitive stimulation and were stable for the life of the slice. Each event was supported by giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Events were similar whether they were evoked in horizontal slices or slices cut perpendicular to the horizontal plane. 3. Bath application of the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-[2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; 5 microM) elevated the threshold for evoking the giant EPSP. Higher concentrations (10-15 microM) reduced the amplitude and duration of the giant EPSP. Bath application of the AMPA receptor antagonist beta-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 5 microM) eliminated the evoked EPSP. 4. In intact slices, superficial layer neurons of pre- and parasubiculum could exhibit EPSPs coincident with bursts recorded in the deep layers. However, in isolated subsections of horizontal slices or in 'vertical slices', both of which contained only pre- and/or parasubiculum, evoked or picrotoxin-induced bursts occurred only in deep layer cells. Superficial layer cells in these subsections showed no response to deep layer events. 5. Antidromic population spikes confirmed projections from superficial cell layers of pre- and parasubiculum down to their deep cell layers. Reciprocal antidromic responses were absent. 6. Axons of superficial layer stellate and pyramidal cells had horizontal collaterals and at least one ascending and one descending collateral. Branches of the descending collaterals were given off in layer V and some axons were found to reach the angular bundle. Axons of deep layer stellate and pyramidal cells also had horizontal collaterals and descending collaterals which could be traced to the angular bundle. One ascending axon collateral was found among the thirty-one deep layer cells examined morphologically. 7. We conclude that the deep layer cells of the presubiculum and parasubiculum are richly interconnected with excitatory synapses. These interconnections can generate giant excitatory synaptic potentials that support the bursting behaviour exhibited by these neurons. Any of the excitatory inputs to deep layer cells can trigger the population bursts and specific inputs from entorhinal cortex produce the after-discharges. Further, connections between superficial and deep layer cells appear to be almost exclusively in the direction of superficial to deep. The absence of significant ascending input can account for the functional separation of superficial and deep layer neurons of presubiculum and parasubiculum.},

The entorhinal connections were also characterized with respect to the LEA and MEA dentate gyrus-projecting bands. In general, the entorhinal connections with the hippocampal formation are much stronger than the perirhinal and postrhinal connections. The entorhinal cortex projects strongly to all components of the hippocampal formation, whereas the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices project weakly and only to CA1 and the subiculum. In addition, the postrhinal cortex preferentially targets the dorsal CA1 and subiculum, whereas the perirhinal cortex targets ventral subiculum. Similarly, the perirhinal cortex receives more input from ventral hippocampal formation structures and the postrhinal cortex receives more input from dorsal hippocampal structures. The LEA and the MEA medial band are more strongly interconnected with ventral hippocampal structures, whereas the MEA lateral band is more interconnected with dorsal hippocampal structures. With regard to the presubiculum and parasubiculum, the postrhinal cortex and the MEA lateral band receive stronger input from the dorsal presubiculum and caudal parasubiculum. In contrast, the LEA and MEA medial bands receive stronger input from the ventral presubiculum and rostral parasubiculum.},

Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.},

  volume = {116},

  abstract = {The superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex receive sensory and associational cortical inputs and provide the hippocampus with the majority of its cortical sensory input. The parasubiculum, which receives input from multiple hippocampal subfields, sends its single major output projection to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that it may modulate processing of synaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Indeed, stimulation of the parasubiculum can enhance entorhinal responses to synaptic input from the piriform cortex in vivo. Theta EEG activity contributes to spatial and mnemonic processes in this region, and the current study assessed how stimulation of the parasubiculum with either single pulses or short, five-pulse, theta-frequency trains may modulate synaptic responses in layer II entorhinal stellate neurons evoked by stimulation of layer I afferents in vitro. Parasubicular stimulation pulses or trains suppressed responses to layer I stimulation at intervals of 5 ms, and parasubicular stimulation trains facilitated layer I responses at a train-pulse interval of 25 ms. This suggests that firing of parasubicular neurons during theta activity may heterosynaptically enhance incoming sensory inputs to the entorhinal cortex. Bath application of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) blocker ZD7288 enhanced the facilitation effect, suggesting that cholinergic inhibition of Ih may contribute. In addition, repetitive pairing of parasubicular trains and layer I stimulation induced a lasting depression of entorhinal responses to layer I stimulation. These findings provide evidence that theta activity in the parasubiculum may promote heterosynaptic modulation effects that may alter sensory processing in the entorhinal cortex.},

Attention focused on the routes taken by these projections, which were delineated by combining surgical tract section with the placement of a tracer. Projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei almost exclusively used the fornix. These relatively light projections, which arose from all areas of the entorhinal cortex, from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and area 35 of the perirhinal cortex, terminated mainly in the anterior ventral nucleus. In contrast, the projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus from the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum were denser than those to the anterior thalamic nuclei. The projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus used two routes. While nearly all of the projections from the subicular complex used the fornix, many of the entorhinal cortex projections passed caudally in the temporopulvinar bundle to reach the lateral dorsal nucleus. The perirhinal cortex, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also projects to nucleus medialis dorsalis. These projections exclusively used the external capsule and thence the inferior thalamic peduncle. Other temporal-thalamic projections included those to the medial pulvinar, via the temporopulvinar bundle, from the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and those to the paraventricular nucleus from the entorhinal cortex. By identifying these routes, it is possible to appreciate how different lesions might disconnect temporal-diencephalic pathways and so contribute to memory disorders.},

In contrast, neurons in the postsubiculum and anterior thalamic nucleus discharge as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of its behavior and location in the environment. Because the parasubiculum (PaS) has extensive connections, either directly or indirectly, with these structures, it is centrally located to influence the neuronal activity in these areas. This study was therefore designed to determine the types of behavioral and spatial correlates in neurons from the PaS. Single unit recordings were conducted in the PaS of freely moving rats trained to retrieve food pellets thrown randomly into a cylindrical apparatus. A total of 10.3\% of the cells were classified as place cells because they discharged in relation to the animal's location in the cylinder. A large percentage of cells (41.4\%) were classified as theta cells. The remaining cells had nondiscernable behavioral correlates. Quantitative analysis of the firing rate maps for the place cells showed they had higher levels of background activity and contained larger firing fields than values reported previously for hippocampal place cells. Directional analysis showed that only three out of 16 cells contained a secondary directional correlate; the firing rate for the remaining cells was not affected by the animal's directional heading within the firing field. A time shift analysis, which shifted the spike time series relative to the animal location series, was conducted to determine whether the quality of the location-specific firing could be improved. The time shifts for three different spatial parameters were optimal when cell discharge led the animal's position. Furthermore, the optimal time shifts for two of these parameters (firing area and information content) were less than the optimal shift reported for hippocampal place cells and suggested that PaS cell discharge lagged behind hippocampal place cell activity. Rotation of the cue card with the animal out of view led to near equal rotation of the firing field when the animal was returned to the apparatus. These results indicate that a small population of cells in the PaS encode the animal's location in its environment, although the representation of space encoded by these cells is different from the type of representation encoded by hippocampal place cells. \textcopyright{} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Estimates of neuron numbers have been useful in studies of neurodegenerative disorders, and in their animal models, and in the computational modeling of hippocampal function. Although the retrohippocampal region (presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area) is an integral part of the hippocampal circuitry and is affected selectively in a number of disorders, estimates of neuron numbers in the rat retrohippocampal region have yet to be published. Such data are necessary ingredients for computational models of the function of this region and will also facilitate a comparison of this region in rats and primates, which will help to determine how well we may expect rat models to predict function and dysfunction in primate brains. In the present study, we used the optical fractionator to estimate the number of neurons in the rat retrohippocampal region. The following estimates were obtained: 3.3 \texttimes{} 105 in presubicular layers II and III, 1.5 \texttimes{} 105 in parasubicular layers II and III, 2.2 \texttimes{} 105 in the combined pre- and parasubicular layers V and VI, 6.6 \texttimes{} 104 in medial entorhinal area (MEA) layer II, 1.3 \texttimes{} 105 in MEA layer III, 1.9 \texttimes{} 105 in MEA layers V and VI, 4.6 \texttimes{} 104 in lateral entorhinal area (LEA) layer II, 1.2 \texttimes{} 105 in LEA layer III, and 1.4 \texttimes{} 105 in LEA layers V and VI. A surprising finding was the large numbers of neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum, which indicate an important role of these areas in the control of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. A comparison of the numbers of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal areas in rats with similar estimates in humans revealed that gross input-output relations are largely conserved. Differences between rats and humans may be accounted for by more prominent entorhino-neocortical projections in primates and consequent increases in the number of neurons in the hippocampus and retrohippocampal region, which are dedicated to these projections.

Repeated arms were presented with lags ranging from zero to six (from zero to six different arm presentations occurred between the first and repeated presentation). After completion of acquisition training (significantly longer latencies for repeated arms in comparison with the first presentation of an arm), rats received lesions of the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, pre- and parasubiculum, or served as sham-operated controls. Based on continued postsurgery training and additional tests, the results indicated that rats with pre- and parasubiculum or pre- and parasubiculum plus medial entorhinal cortex produced sustained impairment in performing the task. Medial or lateral entorhinal cortex and control lesions did not display any sustained deficits. The data suggest that working memory for spatial location information is mediated primarily by the pre- and parasubiculum, but not medial entorhinal and lateral entorhinal cortex.

  volume = {328},

  abstract = {The regional and laminar organization of the projections from the presubiculum and the parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed in the rat with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). The projections from the presubiculum were bilateral and confined to layers III and I of the medial entorhinal area (MEA). Both the ispi- and the contralateral projections showed similar distributions and were almost of equal density. Projections to layer III of the entorhinal cortex arose predominantly from superficial layers of the presubiculum, whereas the fibers that reach layer I of the entorhinal cortex appear to originate preferentially from the deep layers of the presubiculum. These fibers also appeared to innervate weakly layer II of MEA. The parasubiculum distributed projections not only to MEA but also to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), innervating layer II selectively. The innervation of LEA was quite dense and extensive. Very weak projections from the parasubiculum to the contralateral entorhinal cortex were observed in this study. The position of the terminal plexus in the entorhinal cortex was determined by the point of origin along both the dorsoventral and transverse or proximodistal axes of the presubiculum and parasubiculum. Projections from the presubiculum and parasubiculum entered the entorhinal cortex at the level of the injection, or slightly ventral to it, and the main terminal field was always present ventrally to the injection site. The dorsoventral axis of origin thus corresponded to a similarly oriented axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The distribution in relation to the origin along the transverse axis was more complex, and differences between the presubiculum and parasubiculum were present. The proximal presubiculum, i.e., the part closest to the subiculum, projected to the most lateral part of MEA and the central part of the presubiculum sent fibers to the most medial part of MEA. The distal part of the presubiculum, i.e., the part that borders the parasubiculum, projected to the central part of MEA. Projections from the portion of the parasubiculum directly adjacent to the presubiculum, the so-called proximal parasubiculum, reached medial parts of MEA, and those originating in the central part distributed preferentially to lateral parts of MEA and adjacent medial parts of LEA. The distal part of the parasubiculum that borders the entorhinal cortex projected mainly to almost the full mediolateral extent of LEA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The subicular complex, including the prosubiculum (ProS), subiculum (Sub), presubiculum, postsubiculum (PoS), and parasubiculum (PaS), plays important roles in the medial temporal memory system and is heavily involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In the literature, the ProS (in primate) and PoS (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub.},

  abstract = {To determine what influence the pre- and parasubiculum regions of the hippocampal formation have on neural representations within the dorsal hippocampus, single-unit recordings were made as rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions centered on the former regions (n = 4) or control surgeries (n = 3) foraged freely. Spatial firing specificity was measured using an information content procedure. Cells from lesioned animals (n = 57) provided significantly less spatial information than cells from control animals (n = 44). Whereas some degree of location-related activity (place fields) was observed in 98\% of neurons recorded from control animals, it was observed in only 65\% of the neurons from lesioned animals. The spatial resolution of the intact place fields appeared to be compromised in lesioned animals as a result of their having a higher firing rate outside the place field. These findings indicate that the pre- and parasubiculum regions have a major role in maintaining the specificity of the place field firing of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Since previous data indicate that these lesioned animals displayed delay-dependent deficits in spatial tasks, these findings also suggest that a disruption in place field activity may be a causal factor in this spatial memory deficit.},

  abstract = {Although a major output of the hippocampal formation is from the subiculum to the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex, the parasubiculum projects to the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and may therefore modulate how the entorhinal cortex responds to sensory inputs from other cortical regions. Recordings at multiple depths in the entorhinal cortex were first used to characterize field potentials evoked by stimulation of the parasubiculum in urethan-anesthetized rats. Current source density analysis showed that a prominent surface-negative field potential component is generated by synaptic activation in layer II. The surface-negative field potential was also observed in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The response was maintained during short stimulation trains of {$\leq$}125 Hz, suggesting that it is generated by activation of monosynaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex also projects to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and interactions between parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs were investigated using double-site stimulation tests. Simultaneous activation of parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs with high-intensity pulses resulted in smaller synaptic potentials than were expected on the basis of summing the individual responses, consistent with the termination of both pathways onto a common population of neurons. Paired-pulse tests were then used to assess the effect of parasubicular stimulation on responses to piriform cortex stimulation. Responses of the entorhinal cortex to piriform cortex inputs were inhibited when the parasubiculum was stimulated 5 ms earlier and were enhanced when the parasubiculum was stimulated 20\textendash{}150 ms earlier. These results indicate that excitatory inputs to the entorhinal cortex from the parasubiculum may enhance the propagation of neuronal activation patterns into the hippocampal circuit by increasing the responsiveness of the entorhinal cortex to appropriately timed inputs.},

  abstract = {Layer II of the parasubiculum (PaS) receives excitatory synaptic input from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and sends a major output to layer II of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex. The PaS also receives heavy cholinergic innervation from the medial septum, which contributes to the generation of theta-frequency (4\textendash{}12 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Cholinergic receptor activation exerts a wide range of effects in other areas of the hippocampal formation, including membrane depolarization, changes in neuronal excitability, and suppression of excitatory synaptic responses. The present study was aimed at determining how cholinergic receptor activation modulates excitatory synaptic input to the layer II/III neurons of the PaS in acute brain slices. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layer II/III of the PaS were evoked by stimulation of either layer I afferents, or ascending inputs from layer V. Bath-application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (0.5\textendash{}10 {$\mu$}M) suppressed the amplitude of fEPSPs evoked by both superficial- and deep layer stimulation, and also enhanced paired-pulse facilitation. Constant bath-application of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 {$\mu$}M) failed to eliminate the suppression, indicating that the cholinergic suppression of fEPSPs is not due to increased inhibitory tone. The muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 {$\mu$}M) blocked the suppression of fEPSPs, and the selective M1-preferring receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 {$\mu$}M), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1\textendash{}5 {$\mu$}M), also significantly attenuated the suppression. Therefore, cholinergic receptor activation suppresses excitatory synaptic input to layer II/III neurons of the PaS, and this suppression is mediated in part by M1 receptor activation.},

  abstract = {The parasubiculum is a major input structure of layer 2 of medial entorhinal cortex, where most grid cells are found. Here we investigated parasubicular circuits of the rat by anatomical analysis combined with juxtacellular recording/labeling and tetrode recordings during spatial exploration. In tangential sections, the parasubiculum appears as a linear structure flanking the medial entorhinal cortex mediodorsally. With a length of \&\#x223C;5.2 mm and a width of only \&\#x223C;0.3 mm (approximately one dendritic tree diameter), the parasubiculum is both one of the longest and narrowest cortical structures. Parasubicular neurons span the height of cortical layers 2 and 3, and we observed no obvious association of deep layers to this structure. The "superficial parasubiculum" (layers 2 and 1) divides into \&\#x223C;15 patches, whereas deeper parasubicular sections (layer 3) form a continuous band of neurons. Anterograde tracing experiments show that parasubicular neurons extend long "circumcurrent" axons establishing a "global" internal connectivity. The parasubiculum is a prime target of GABAergic and cholinergic medial septal inputs. Other input structures include the subiculum, presubiculum, and anterior thalamus. Functional analysis of identified and unidentified parasubicular neurons shows strong theta rhythmicity of spiking, a large fraction of head-direction selectivity (50\%, 34 of 68), and spatial responses (grid, border and irregular spatial cells, 57\%, 39 of 68). Parasubicular output preferentially targets patches of calbindin-positive pyramidal neurons in layer 2 of medial entorhinal cortex, which might be relevant for grid cell function. These findings suggest the parasubiculum might shape entorhinal theta rhythmicity and the (dorsoventral) integration of information across grid scales.},

  abstract = {The present study describes the differences and similarities between the connections of the presubiculum and parasubiculum based on retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments. The results demonstrate that both areas have several similar afferent connections, particularly those from subcortical areas such as the claustrum, diagonal band of Broca, anterior thalamus, nucleus reuniens, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. Both subicular areas also are innervated by axons originating in the ipsilateral and contralateral entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. In contrast to these similarities, most axons innervating the presubiculum originate in the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, the claustrum, and the contralateral presubiculum. Conversely, the parasubiculum is innervated primarily by axons that originate in area CA1 of the hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, and the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum. The major efferent projection from the presubiculum and parasubiculum courses bilaterally to the medial entorhinal cortex; however, the results of the present study confirm previous suggestions that presubicular axons terminate almost exclusively in layers I and III, whereas parasubicular axons innervate layer II. The presubiculum also projects to the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and the lateral ventral portion of the medial mammillary nucleus, whereas the parasubiculum projects prominently to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the contralateral presubiculum and parasubiculum, and the lateral dorsal segment of the medial mammillary nucleus. Thus despite some similarities, the major connections of presubiculum and parasubiculum are distinct from one another and distinct from the projections of the adjacent subiculum and postsubiculum. These results suggest that the subicular cortex is considerably more complex than previously envisioned and indicate that each segment may subserve a distinct role in the processing of information by the hippocampal formation.},

In particular, it is unclear why certain cell types are selective to one spatial variable, but invariant to another. For example, place cells are typically invariant to head direction. We propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns - in both their selectivity and their invariance - arise from the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of different input statistics along different spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents. The model is robust to changes in parameters, develops patterns on behavioral timescales and makes distinctive experimental predictions.},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) signaling shapes neuronal circuit development and underlies specific aspects of cognitive functions and behaviors, including attention, learning, memory and motivation. During behavior, activation of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs) by ACh alters the activation state of neurons, and neuronal circuits most likely process information differently with elevated levels of ACh. In several brain regions, ACh has been shown to alter synaptic strength as well. By changing the rules for synaptic plasticity, ACh can have prolonged effects on and rearrange connectivity between neurons that outlasts its presence. From recent discoveries in the mouse, rat, monkey and human brain, a picture emerges in which the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic system targets the neocortex with much more spatial and temporal detail than previously considered. Fast cholinergic synapses acting on a millisecond time scale are abundant in the mammalian cerebral cortex, and provide BF cholinergic neurons with the possibility to rapidly alter information flow in cortical microcircuits. Finally, recent studies have outlined novel mechanisms of how cholinergic projections from the BF affect synaptic strength in several brain areas of the rodent brain, with behavioral consequences. This review highlights these exciting developments and discusses how these findings translate to human brain circuitries.},

To understand how grid cell firing arises from the combination of intrinsic conductances and synaptic input in medial entorhinal stellate cells, we performed patch-clamp recordings in mice navigating in a virtual-reality environment. We found that the membrane potential signature of stellate cells during firing field crossings consisted of a slow depolarization driving spike output. This was best predicted by network models in which neurons receive sustained depolarizing synaptic input during a field crossing, such as continuous attractor network models of grid cell firing. Another key feature of the data, phase precession of intracellular theta oscillations and spiking with respect to extracellular theta oscillations, was best captured by an oscillatory interference model. Thus, these findings provide crucial new information for a quantitative understanding of the cellular basis of spatial navigation in the entorhinal cortex.},

These nested gamma oscillations closely resemble activity during spatial exploration, are generated by local feedback inhibition without recurrent excitation, and have clock-like features suitable as reference signals for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded grid firing fields. In network models deduced from our data, feedback inhibition supports coexistence of theta-nested gamma oscillations with attractor states that generate grid firing fields. These results indicate that grid cells communicate primarily via inhibitory interneurons. This circuit mechanism enables multiplexing of oscillation-based temporal codes with rate-coded attractor states.},

CA1 interneurons are a diverse group consisting of many subtypes, some of which provide compartment-specific inhibition specifically onto pyramidal neuron dendrites. In fact, the majority of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neurons is found on their dendrites. The specific role of a dendrite-innervating interneuron subtype is primarily determined by its innervation pattern on the distinct dendritic domains of pyramidal neurons. The efficacy of dendritic inhibition in reducing dendritic excitation depends on the relative timing and location of the activated excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In vivo, synaptic properties such as short-term plasticity and neuro-modulation by the basal forebrain, govern the degree of inhibition in distinct dendritic domains in a dynamic, behavior dependent manner, specifically during network oscillation such as the theta rhythm. In this review we focus on two subtypes of dendrite-innervating interneurons: the oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneuron and the bistratified interneuron. Their molecular marker profile, morphology, and function in vivo and in vitro are well studied. We strive to integrate this diverse information from the cellular to the network level, and to provide insight into how the different characteristics of O-LM and bistratified interneurons affect dendritic excitability, network activity, and behavior.},

These oscillations are prominent in the local field potential, and they also reflect the subthreshold membrane potential and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons. The prevailing view is that theta oscillations are synchronized throughout the hippocampus, despite the lack of conclusive experimental evidence. In contrast, here we show that in freely behaving rats, theta oscillations in area CA1 are travelling waves that propagate roughly along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we find that spiking in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer is modulated in a consistent travelling wave pattern. Our results demonstrate that theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity not only in time, but also across anatomical space. The presence of travelling waves indicates that the instantaneous output of the hippocampus is topographically organized and represents a segment, rather than a point, of physical space.},

NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 22(2), 275\textendash{}290, 1998.\textemdash{}In the behaving rat, theta rhythm was dominant during walking and rapid-eye-movement sleep, while irregular slow activity predominated during immobility and slow-wave sleep. Oscillatory evoked potentials of 20\textendash{}50Hz and spontaneous fast (gamma) waves were more prominent during theta compared with non-theta behaviors. The oscillations were simulated by a systems model with recurrent inhibition. The model also predicts a behaviorally dependent inhibition, which was confirmed experimentally using paired-pulse responses. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the population spikes in CA1 was larger during walking than immobility, mostly mediated by a cholinergic input. Spike responses in vitro were characterized by a relative lack of inhibition or disinhibition compared with the behaving rat. The two-input, two-dipole model of the theta rhythm in CA1 is reviewed. Afferents to the CA1 pyramidal cells are assumed to be rhythmic and consist of atropine-sensitive and atropine-resistant inputs driving the somata and distal dendrites, respectively. The atropine-sensitive theta rhythm was mainly caused by a series of Cl- mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) on pyramidal cells. It is suggested that previous claims of the participation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and not IPSPs in the intracellular recordings in vivo were flawed. Single cell recordings in vitro suggested that intrinsic voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations modulate the response to a theta-frequency driving. Membrane potentials of pyramidal cells in vitro showed resonance in the theta frequency range.},

However, neuropsychological studies in humans have emphasized the importance of parietal cortex for spatial navigation, and efforts to identify the electrophysiological signs of spatial navigation in humans have been stymied by the difficulty of recording during free exploration of complex environments. We resolved the recording problem and experimentally probed brain activity of human participants who were fully ambulant. On each of 2 d, electroencephalography was synchronized with head and body movement in 13 subjects freely navigating an extended virtual environment containing numerous unique objects. \texttheta{} phase and amplitude recorded over parietal cortex were consistent when subjects walked through a particular spatial separation at widely separated times. This spatial displacement \texttheta{} autocorrelation (STAcc) was quantified and found to be significant from 2 to 8 Hz within the environment. Similar autocorrelation analyses performed on an electrooculographic channel, used to measure eye movements, showed no significant spatial autocorrelations, ruling out eye movements as the source of STAcc. Strikingly, the strength of an individual's STAcc maps from day 1 significantly predicted object location recall success on day 2. \texttheta{} was also significantly correlated with walking speed; however, this correlation appeared unrelated to STAcc and did not predict memory performance. This is the first demonstration of memory-related, spatial maps in humans generated during active spatial exploration.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) modulates neuronal network activities implicated in cognition, including theta and gamma oscillations but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Joint measurements of cholinergic activity and neuronal network dynamics with high spatio-temporal resolution are critical to understand ACh neuromodulation. However, current electrochemical biosensors are not optimized to measure nanomolar cholinergic signals across small regions like hippocampal sub-layers.Here, we report a novel oxidase-based electrochemical biosensor that matches these constraints. The approach is based on measurement of H2O2 generated by choline oxidase (ChOx) in the presence of choline (Ch). The microelectrode design consists of a twisted pair of 50{$\mathrm{\mu}$}m diameter Pt/Ir wires (sensor and sentinel), which is scalable, provides high spatial resolution and optimizes common mode rejection. Microelectrode coating with ChOx in chitosan cross-linked with benzoquinone is simple, mechanically robust and provides high sensitivity (324{$\pm$}46nA{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M-1cm-2), a limit of detection of 16nM and a t50 response time of 1.4s.Local field potential (LFP)-related currents dominate high-frequency component of electrochemical recordings in vivo. We significantly improved signal-to-noise-ratio compared to traditional sentinel subtraction by a novel frequency domain common mode rejection procedure that accounts for differential phase and amplitude of LFP-related currents on the two channels.We demonstrate measurements of spontaneous nanomolar Ch fluctuations, on top of which micromolar Ch increases occurred during periods of theta activity in anesthetized rats. Measurements were not affected by physiological O2 changes, in agreement with the low biosensor Km for O2 (2.6{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M). Design and performance of the novel biosensor opens the way for multisite recordings of spontaneous cholinergic dynamics in behaving animals.},

  abstract = {In the mammalian cerebral cortex the diversity of interneuronal subtypes underlies a division of labour subserving distinct modes of inhibitory control. A unique mode of inhibitory control may be provided by inhibitory neurons that specifically suppress the firing of other inhibitory neurons. Such disinhibition could lead to the selective amplification of local processing and serve the important computational functions of gating and gain modulation. Although several interneuron populations are known to target other interneurons to varying degrees, little is known about interneurons specializing in disinhibition and their in vivo function. Here we show that a class of interneurons that express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory control in multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by reinforcement signals. By combining optogenetic activation with single-cell recordings, we examined the functional role of VIP interneurons in awake mice, and investigated the underlying circuit mechanisms in vitro in auditory and medial prefrontal cortices. We identified a basic disinhibitory circuit module in which activation of VIP interneurons transiently suppresses primarily somatostatin- and a fraction of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that specialize in the control of the input and output of principal cells, respectively. During the performance of an auditory discrimination task, reinforcement signals (reward and punishment) strongly and uniformly activated VIP neurons in auditory cortex, and in turn VIP recruitment increased the gain of a functional subpopulation of principal neurons. These results reveal a specific cell type and microcircuit underlying disinhibitory control in cortex and demonstrate that it is activated under specific behavioural conditions.},

Sleep and wakefulness are regulated by the aminergic, cholinergic brainstem and hypothalamic systems. Activation of the HPA and/or the sympathetic nervous systems results in wakefulness and these hormones including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol or corticosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, are associated with attention and arousal. Stress-related insomnia leads to a vicious circle by activating the HPA system. An awareness of the close interaction between sleep and stress systems is emerging and the hypothalamus is now recognized as a key center for sleep regulation, with hypothalamic neurontransmitter systems providing the framework for therapeutic advances. An updated understanding of these systems may allow researchers to elucidate neural mechanisms of sleep disorder and to develop effective intervention for sleep disorder.},

To explore synaptic signaling of cholinergic forebrain neurons, we activated choline acetyltransferase expressing neurons using channelrhodopsin while recording post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in layer 1 interneurons. Surprisingly, we observed PSCs mediated by GABAA receptors in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Based on PSC latency and pharmacological sensitivity, our results suggest monosynaptic release of both GABA and ACh. Anatomical analysis showed that forebrain cholinergic neurons express the GABA synthetic enzyme Gad2 and the vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1). We confirmed the direct release of GABA by knocking out Slc32a1 from cholinergic neurons. Our results identify GABA as an overlooked fast neurotransmitter utilized throughout the forebrain cholinergic system.

Here we performed whole-brain mapping of both inputs and outputs of four BF cell types - cholinergic, glutamatergic, and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons - in the mouse brain. Using rabies virus -mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing to label the inputs and adeno-associated virus to trace axonal projections, we identified numerous brain areas connected to the BF. The inputs to different cell types were qualitatively similar, but the output projections showed marked differences. The connections to glutamatergic and SOM+ neurons were strongly reciprocal, while those to cholinergic and PV+ neurons were more unidirectional. These results reveal the long-range wiring diagram of the BF circuit with highly convergent inputs and divergent outputs and point to both functional commonality and specialization of different BF cell types.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholine is a crucial neuromodulator for attention, learning and memory. Release of acetylcholine in primary sensory cortex enhances processing of sensory stimuli, and many in vitro studies have pinpointed cellular mechanisms that could mediate this effect. In contrast, how cholinergic modulation shapes the function of intact circuits during behaviour is only beginning to emerge. Here we review recent data on the recruitment of identified interneuron types in neocortex by cholinergic signalling, obtained with a combination of genetic targeting of cell types, two-photon imaging and optogenetics. These results suggest that acetylcholine release during basal forebrain stimulation, and during physiological recruitment of the basal forebrain, can strongly and rapidly influence the firing of neocortical interneurons. In contrast to the traditional view of neuromodulation as a relatively slow process, cholinergic signalling can thus rapidly convey time-locked information to neocortex about the behavioural state of the animal and the occurrence of salient sensory stimuli. Importantly, these effects strongly depend on interneuron type, and different interneuron types in turn control distinct aspects of circuit function. One prominent effect of phasic acetylcholine release is disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, which can facilitate sensory processing and associative learning.},

The functional differentiation along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is poorly demarcated in comparison with the transverse axis. Using patch clamp recordings in conjunction with post hoc anatomy, we have examined the pattern of connectivity and the functional differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus. Here, we provide anatomical and physiological evidence that the prominent rhythmic network activities of the hippocampus, the behavior-specific gamma and theta oscillations, are seen predominantly along the transverse and longitudinal axes respectively. This orthogonal relationship is the result of the axonal field trajectories and the consequential interaction of the principal cells and major interneuron subtypes involved in generating each rhythm. Thus, the axonal arborization patterns of hippocampal inhibitory cells may represent a structural framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of activity observed within the hippocampus.},

Mutations in humans or genetically targeted deletions in mice of either Kiss1 or Kiss1r cause profound hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Neurons that express Kiss1/kisspeptin are found in discrete nuclei in the hypothalamus, as well as other brain regions in many vertebrates, and their distribution, regulation, and function varies widely across species. Kisspeptin neurons directly innervate and stimulate GnRH neurons, which are the final common pathway through which the brain regulates reproduction. Kisspeptin neurons are sexually differentiated with respect to cell number and transcriptional activity in certain brain nuclei, and some kisspeptin neurons express other cotransmitters, including dynorphin and neurokinin B (whose physiological significance is unknown). Kisspeptin neurons express the estrogen receptor and the androgen receptor, and these cells are direct targets for the action of gonadal steroids in both male and female animals. Kisspeptin signaling in the brain has been implicated in mediating the negative feedback action of sex steroids on gonadotropin secretion, generating the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge, triggering and guiding the tempo of sexual maturation at puberty, controlling seasonal reproduction, and restraining reproductive activity during lactation. Kisspeptin signaling may also serve diverse functions outside of the classical realm of reproductive neuroendocrinology, including the regulation of metastasis in certain cancers, vascular dynamics, placental physiology, and perhaps even higher-order brain function.},

This evidence comes mainly from models of heterosynaptic facilitation in which acetylcholine produces a strengthening of a second, noncholinergic synaptic input onto the same neuron. The argument that the basal forebrain cholinergic system is essential in some models of plasticity is supported by studies that have selectively lesioned the cholinergic basal forebrain. This review will examine the mechanisms whereby acetylcholine might induce synaptic plasticity.

  volume = {36},
  issn = {0270-6474},
  abstract = {We have recently described a slow oscillation in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized mice, which couples to nasal respiration and is clearly distinct from co-occurring theta oscillations. Here we set out to investigate whether such type of patterned network activity, which we named ``hippocampal respiration rhythm'' (HRR), also occurs in awake mice. In freely moving mice, instantaneous respiration rate is extremely variable, and respiration is superimposed by bouts of sniffing. To reduce this variability, we clamped the behavior of the animal to either awake immobility or treadmill running by using a head-fixed setup while simultaneously recording respiration and field potentials from the olfactory bulb (OB) and hippocampus. Head-fixed animals often exhibited long periods of steady respiration rate during either immobility or running, which allowed for spectral and coherence analyses with a sufficient frequency resolution to sort apart respiration and theta activities. We could thus demonstrate the existence of HRR in awake animals, namely, a respiration-entrained slow rhythm with highest amplitude at the dentate gyrus. HRR was most prominent during immobility and running with respiration rates slower than theta oscillations. Nevertheless, HRR could also be faster than theta. Discharges of juxtacellularly recorded cells in CA1 and dentate gyrus were modulated by HRR and theta oscillations. Granger directionality analysis revealed that HRR is caused by the OB and that theta oscillations in OB are caused by the hippocampus. Our results suggest that respiration-coupled oscillations aid the exchange of information between olfactory and memory networks. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Olfaction is a major sense in rodents. In consequence, the olfactory bulb (OB) should be able to transmit information to downstream regions. Here we report potential mechanisms underlying such information transfer. We demonstrate the existence of a respiration-entrained rhythm in the hippocampus of awake mice. Frequencies of the hippocampal respiration rhythm (HRR) overlap with classical theta oscillations, but both rhythms are clearly distinct. HRR is most prominent in the dentate gyrus, especially when respiration is slower than theta frequency. Discharges of neurons in CA1 and dentate gyrus are modulated by both HRR and theta. Directionality analysis shows that HRR is caused by the OB. Our results suggest that respiration-coupled oscillations aid the exchange of information between olfactory and memory networks.},

  abstract = {The septum is a basal forebrain region located between the lateral ventricles in rodents. It consists of lateral and medial divisions. Medial septal projections regulate hippocampal theta rhythm whereas lateral septal projections are involved in processes such as affective functions, memory formation, and behavioral responses. Gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons of the septal region possess the 65 and 67 isoforms of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Although data on the glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform distribution in the septal region generally appears to indicate glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 dominance, different studies have given inconsistent results in this regard. The aim of this study was therefore to obtain information on the distributions of both of these glutamic acid decarboxylase isoforms in the septal region in transgenic mice. Two animal groups of glutamic acid decarboxylase-green fluorescent protein knock-in transgenic mice were utilized in the experiment. Brain sections from the region were taken for anti-green fluorescent protein immunohistochemistry in order to obtain estimated quantitative data on the number of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons. Following the immunohistochemical procedures, the mean numbers of labeled cells in the lateral and medial septal nuclei were obtained for the two isoform groups. Statistical analysis yielded significant results which indicated that the 65 isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase predominates in both lateral and medial septal nuclei (unpaired two-tailed t-test p\&\#xA0;\&lt;\&\#xA0;0.0001 for LS, p\&\#xA0;\&lt;\&\#xA0;0.01 for MS).

  abstract = {Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex encode location through spatial firing fields that have a grid-like organisation. The challenge of identifying mechanisms for grid firing has been addressed through experimental and theoretical investigations of medial entorhinal circuits. Here, we discuss evidence for continuous attractor network models that account for grid firing by synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models assume that grid-like firing patterns are the result of computation of location from velocity inputs, with additional spatial input required to oppose drift in the attractor state. We focus on properties of continuous attractor networks that are revealed by explicitly considering excitatory and inhibitory neurons, their connectivity and their membrane potential dynamics. Models at this level of detail can account for theta-nested gamma oscillations as well as grid firing, predict spatial firing of interneurons as well as excitatory cells, show how gamma oscillations can be modulated independently from spatial computations, reveal critical roles for neuronal noise, and demonstrate that only a subset of excitatory cells in a network need have grid-like firing fields. Evaluating experimental data against predictions from detailed network models will be important for establishing the mechanisms mediating grid firing.},

Our intracellular recordings show that the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) allows post-inhibitory-rebound spikes (PIRS) in mEC-LII-SCs. In vivo, strong inhibitory-post-synaptic potentials immediately preceded most APs shortening their delay and enhancing excitability. In vitro experiments showed that inhibition initiated spikes more effectively than excitation and that more dorsal mEC-LII-SCs produced faster and more synchronous spikes. In contrast, PIRS in Layer-II/III pyramidal cells were harder to evoke, voltage-independent, and slower in dorsal mEC. In computational simulations, mEC-LII-SCs morphology and Ih homeostatically regulated the dorso-ventral differences in PIRS timing and most dendrites generated PIRS with a narrow range of stimulus amplitudes. These results suggest inhibitory inputs could mediate the emergence of grid cell firing in a neuronal network.},

A computational modelling study by Hasselmo (Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B, Biol. Sci. 369:20120523, 2013) showed that an inhibitory network of such cells can support periodic travelling waves with a period that is controlled by the dynamics of the Ih current. Hasselmo has suggested that these waves can underlie the generation of grid cells, and that the known difference in Ih resonance frequency along the dorsal to ventral axis can explain the observed size and spacing between grid cell firing fields. Here we develop a biophysical spiking model within a framework that allows for analytical tractability. We combine the simplicity of integrate-and-fire neurons with a piecewise linear caricature of the gating dynamics for HCN channels to develop a spiking neural field model of MEC. Using techniques primarily drawn from the field of nonsmooth dynamical systems we show how to construct periodic travelling waves, and in particular the dispersion curve that determines how wave speed varies as a function of period. This exhibits a wide range of long wavelength solutions, reinforcing the idea that rebound spiking is a candidate mechanism for generating grid cell firing patterns. Importantly we develop a wave stability analysis to show how the maximum allowed period is controlled by the dynamical properties of the Ih current. Our theoretical work is validated by numerical simulations of the spiking model in both one and two dimensions.},

The MHb receives GABAergic input from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB), yet the synaptic mechanism that regulates MHb activity is unclear. GABA (\&\#x3B3; -aminobutyric acid) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter activating both GABA\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}A\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\} receptors and GABA\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}B\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\} receptors. Depending on intracellular chloride concentration, however, GABA\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}A\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\} receptors also function in an excitatory manner. In the absence of various synaptic inputs, we found that MHb neurons displayed spontaneous tonic firing at a rate of about \{\textbackslash{}textasciitilde\}4.4\&\#x2009;Hz. Optogenetic stimulation of MS/DB inputs to the MHb evoked GABA\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}A\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\} receptor-mediated synaptic currents, which produced stimulus-locked neuronal firing.

  abstract = {The firing of neurons from layers II and III of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) was examined in relation to the hippocampal theta rhythm in urethane anesthetized and walking rats. 1) MEC neurons showed a significant phase relation to the hippocampal theta rhythm in both walking and urethane anesthetized rats, suggesting that this region contributes to the generation of both atropine-resistant and atropine-sensitive theta rhythm components. 2) The proportion of phase-locked cells was three times greater in walking rats (22/23 cells) as compared to anesthetized rats (8/23 cells), indicating that MEC cells made a greater contribution during walking theta rhythm. This difference was also manifest in the greater mean vector length for the group of phase-locked MEC cells during walking: 0.39 {$\pm$} 0.13 versus 0.21 {$\pm$} 0.08. Firing rate differences between walking and urethane conditions were not significant. 3) In walking rats, MEC cells fired on the positive peak of the dentate theta rhythm (group mean phase = 5\textdegree; 0\textdegree{} = positive peak at the hippocampal fissure). This is close to the reported phases for dentate granule and hippocampal pyramidal cells. The distribution of MEC cell phases in urethane anesthetized rats was broader (group mean phase = 90\textdegree{}), consistent with the phase data reported for hippocampal projection cells. These findings suggest that medial entorhinal neurons are the principal determinant of theta-related firing of hippocampal neurons and that their robust rhythmicity in walking as compared to urethane anesthesia accounts for EEG differences across the two conditions.},

  abstract = {Medial septal GABAergic neurons of the basal forebrain innervate the hippocampus and related cortical areas, contributing to the coordination of network activity, such as theta oscillations and sharp wave-ripple events, via a preferential innervation of GABAergic interneurons. Individual medial septal neurons display diverse activity patterns, which may be related to their termination in different cortical areas and/or to the different types of innervated interneurons. To test these hypotheses, we extracellularly recorded and juxtacellularly labeled single medial septal neurons in anesthetized rats in vivo during hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations, traced their axons to distant cortical target areas, and analyzed their postsynaptic interneurons. Medial septal GABAergic neurons exhibiting different hippocampal theta phase preferences and/or sharp wave-ripple related activity terminated in restricted hippocampal regions, and selectively targeted a limited number of interneuron types, as established on the basis of molecular markers. We demonstrate the preferential innervation of bistratified cells in CA1 and of basket cells in CA3 by individual axons. One group of septal neurons was suppressed during sharp wave-ripples, maintained their firing rate across theta and non-theta network states and mainly fired along the descending phase of CA1 theta oscillations. In contrast, neurons that were active during sharp wave-ripples increased their firing significantly during "theta" compared to "non-theta" states, with most firing during the ascending phase of theta oscillations. These results demonstrate that specialized septal GABAergic neurons contribute to the coordination of network activity through parallel, target area- and cell type-selective projections to the hippocampus.},

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the piriform (olfactory) cortex were recorded in the medial entorhinal cortex during behaviors associated with theta activity (active mobility) and were compared with those recorded during nontheta behaviors (awake immobility and slow wave sleep). Synaptic responses were smaller during behavioral activity than during awake immobility and sleep, and responses recorded during movement were largest during the negative phase of the theta rhythm. Systemic administration of cholinergic agonists reduced the amplitude of fEPSPs, and the muscarinic receptor blocker scopolamine strongly enhanced fEPSPs, suggesting that the theta-related suppression of fEPSPs is mediated in part by cholinergic inputs. The reduction in fEPSPs was investigated using in vitro intracellular recordings of EPSPs in Layer II neurons evoked by stimulation of Layer I afferents. Constant bath application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol depolarized membrane potential and suppressed EPSP amplitude in Layer II neurons. The suppression of EPSPs was not associated with a substantial change in input resistance, and could not be accounted for by a depolarization-induced reduction in driving force on the EPSP. The GABAA receptor-blocker bicuculline (50 {$\mu$}M) did not prevent the cholinergic suppression of EPSPs, suggesting that the suppression is not dependent on inhibitory mechanisms. Paired-pulse facilitation of field and intracellular EPSPs were enhanced by carbachol, indicating that the suppression is likely due to inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release. These results indicate that, in addition to well known effects on postsynaptic conductances that increase cellular excitability, cholinergic activation in the entorhinal cortex results in a strong reduction in strength of excitatory synaptic inputs from the piriform cortex. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Theta rhythms are important for hippocampal synchronization during episodic memory processing; thus, it is assumed that theta rhythms follow these excitatory feedforward circuits. To the contrary, we found that theta rhythms generated in the rat subiculum flowed backward to actively modulate spike timing and local network rhythms in CA1 and CA3. This reversed signaling involved GABAergic mechanisms. However, when hippocampal circuits were physically limited to a lamellar slab, CA3 outputs synchronized CA1 and the subiculum using excitatory mechanisms, as predicted by classic hippocampal models. Finally, analysis of in vivo recordings revealed that this reversed theta flow was most prominent during REM sleep. These data demonstrate that communication between CA3, CA1 and the subiculum is not exclusively unidirectional or excitatory and that reversed inhibitory theta signaling also contributes to intrahippocampal synchrony.},

  abstract = {During working memory tasks, the hippocampus exhibits synchronous theta-band activity, which is thought to be correlated with the short-term memory maintenance of salient stimuli. Recent studies indicate that the hippocampus contains the necessary circuitry allowing it to generate and sustain theta oscillations without the need of extrinsic drive. However, the cellular and network mechanisms supporting synchronous rhythmic activity are far from being fully understood. Based on electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal pyramidal CA1 cells, we present a possible mechanism for the maintenance of such rhythmic theta-band activity in the isolated hippocampus. Our model network, based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, comprising pyramidal neurons equipped with calcium-activated nonspecific cationic (CAN) ion channels, is able to generate and sustain synchronized theta oscillations (4\textendash{}12 Hz), following a transient stimulation. The synchronous network activity is maintained by an intrinsic CAN current (ICAN), in the absence of constant external input. When connecting the pyramidal-CAN network to fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, the dynamics of the model reveal that feedback inhibition improves the robustness of fast theta oscillations, by tightening the synchronization of the pyramidal CAN neurons. The frequency and power of the theta oscillations are both modulated by the intensity of the ICAN, which allows for a wide range of oscillation rates within the theta band. This biologically plausible mechanism for the maintenance of synchronous theta oscillations in the hippocampus aims at extending the traditional models of septum-driven hippocampal rhythmic activity. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Theta rhythm is the best synchronized electroencephalographic activity that can be recorded from the mammalian brain. Hippocampal formation is considered to be the main structure involved in the generation of this activity. Although detailed studies of the physiology and pharmacology of theta-band oscillations have been carried out since the early 1950s, the first demonstration of atropine-sensitive theta rhythm, recorded in completely deafferented hippocampal slices of a rat, was performed in the second half of the 1980s. Since the discovery of cholinergically induced in vitro theta rhythm recorded from hippocampal formation slices, the central mechanisms underlying theta generation have been successfully studied in in vitro conditions. Most of these experiments were focused on the basic question regarding the similarities between the cholinergically induced theta activity and theta rhythm examined in vivo. The results of numerous in vitro experiments strongly suggest that cholinergically induced theta rhythm recorded in hippocampal slices is a useful analogue of theta observed in intact animals, and could be helpful in searching for the mechanisms of oscillations and synchrony in the central nervous system neuronal networks. The objective of the present review is to discuss the main results of experiments concerning theta oscillations recorded in in vitro conditions. It is our intent to provide, on the basis of these results, the characteristics of essential mechanisms underlying the generation of atropine-sensitive in vitro theta.},

Conversely, we demonstrate these SPW sequences were present in trained rats even after episodic memory was impaired and after other internal sequences - episode field and theta sequences - were eliminated. SPW sequences did not support memory despite continuing to 'replay' all task-related sequences - place- field and episode field sequences. Sequence replay occurred selectively during synchronous increases of population excitability \textendash{} SPWs.

The second objective of our studies was to verify our earlier in vitro findings and to demonstrate, for the first time, gating cells in intact hippocampus during the generation of Type II theta in urethane anaesthetized rats. Two hundred ninety-nine theta-related cells were isolated and recorded from in vivo and in vitro hippocampal formation. Twenty out of all 299 neurons (6.6\%) were classified as gating cells. The neuron was classified as a gating cell if it met one of the following criteria: (i) the cell discharges occurred precisely in the beginning and at the end of each theta epoch (gating cell A); (ii) the cell began to discharge just before the transition from non-theta interval/LIA into the theta epoch (gating cell B); (iii) the cell began to discharge just after the transition from the theta epoch into non-theta interval/LIA (gating cell C). Our data demonstrates that the appearance of theta epochs and their length, as well as the appearance of non-theta states (in vivo recorded LIA or in vitro recorded intervals between theta epochs) and their length, may require the existence of a specific population of hippocampal neurons which we termed gating cells. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

For this reason, we established an in vitro theta model in a septo-entorhinal-hippocampal brain slice tri-culture system by pairing septal cholinergic inputs with hippocampal local activities. Our study shows that the local entorhinal cortical circuit may play an active and critical role in hippocampal theta rhythm generation.

  abstract = {The theta rhythm is the largest extracellular synchronous signal that can be recorded from the mammalian brain, and has been strongly implicated in mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. We advance the proposal that the theta rhythm represents a ``tag'' for short-term memory processing in the hippocampus. We propose that the hippocampus receives two main types of input, theta from ascending brainstem-diencephalo-septal systems and ``information bearing'' mainly from thalamocortical and cortical systems. The temporal convergence of activity of these two systems results in the encoding of information in the hippocampus, primarily reaching it via cortical routes. By analogy to processes associated with long-term potentiation (LTP), we suggest that theta represents a strong depolarizing influence on NMDA receptor-containing cells of the hippocampus. The temporal coupling of a theta-induced depolarization and the release of glutamate to these cells from intra- and extrahippocampal sources activates them. This, in turn, initiates processes leading to a (short-term) strengthening of connections between presynaptic (``information bearing'') and postsynaptic neurons of the hippocampus. Theta is selectively present in the rat during active exploratory movements. During exploration, a rat continually gathers and updates information about its environment. If this information is temporally coupled to theta (as with the case of locomotion), it becomes temporarily stored in the hippocampus by mechanisms similar to the early phase of LTP (E-LTP). If the exploratory behavior of the rat goes unreinforced, these relatively short-lasting traces (1\textendash{}3 h) gradually weaken and eventually fade\textemdash{}to be reupdated. On the other hand, if the explorations of the rat lead to rewards (or punishments), additional modulatory inputs to the hippocampus become activated and convert the short-term, theta-dependent memory, into long-term stores. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Discharging neurons phase-locked to hippocampal theta waves have been observed in the dorsal raphe, nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and especially in the supramammillary region of rats. Since these areas are reciprocally interconnected with the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, it would aid our understanding of limbic function to elucidate the location and neurochemical content of the entorhino-septal and septo-supramammillary projection neurons, as well as that of their postsynaptic targets. Light and electron microscopic immunostaining for calretinin, in combination with antero- and retrograde tracer techniques, postembedding immunostaining for GABA and the transmitter specific [3H]d-aspartate retrograde radiolabeling, as well as a co-localization experiment for calretinin and glutamate decarboxylase in rat supramammillary and septal neurons, demonstrated that: (i) a large population of entorhinal cells that forms asymmetric synaptic contacts on calretinin-containing neurons located at the border between the medial and lateral septal areas contains calretinin and are aspartate/glutamatergic; (ii) the overwhelming majority of calretinin-immunoreactive cells located at the border between the lateral and medial septal area are GABAergic; (iii) these neurons can be retrogradely labeled from the supramammillary area; (iv) anterogradely labeled axons originating in the border between the medial and lateral septum are GABAergic and (v) terminate on supramammillary area non-GABAergic, calretinin-containing neurons, which are known to project to the septal complex and hippocampus.These observations indicate that a large population of cells participating in the hippocampal feedback regulation of theta regulation/generation contain the same calcium-binding protein.

MS-DBB cells were studied during large amplitude irregular activity and during hippocampal theta rhythm, elicited by either sensory (i.e. stroking the fur on the animal's back) or electrical stimulation of the reticularis pontis oralis nucleus (RPO). Three types of cells were described according to their firing pattern and the characteristics of their "intracellular theta" rhythm. Type A neurons displayed continuous rhythmic oscillations in the membrane potential (Vm) of approximately 17 mV. These oscillations generated rhythmic high-frequency spike trains which were phase-locked with hippocampal theta rhythm. Type A cells revealed intracellular theta rhythm even in the absence of hippocampal theta rhythm, suggesting that the activity of this type of cell was the most important in hippocampal theta genesis. Type B cells were characterized by marked postspike after hyperpolarization and intracellular theta oscillations of smaller amplitude than in type A cells. Type C cells revealed a postspike afterdepolarization and a lower amplitude, intracellular theta rhythm only in the presence of hippocampal theta rhythm. Type C neurons could fire slow spikes at depolarizing (46\% of cells) or hyperpolarizing (15\% of cells) Vms. Type B and C cells were intracellularly stained with Lucifer yellow. Although type B and C neurons revealed dissimilar electrophysiological properties, they had comparable morphological shapes. RPO electrical stimulation generated hippocampal theta rhythm and intracellular theta rhythm in types A and B cells but not in type C cells, and increased the spike rate in type C neurons. Electrical stimulation of the fornix only evoked synaptic responses in type B and C neurons, with antidromic responses being elicited in 12\% of type C cells. These results indicate that probably most of the type A rhythmic cells did not receive direct hippocampal feedback and that at least some type C cells were projecting neurons. The present findings demonstrate that theta rhythm oscillations in the Vm of MS-DBB neurons elicit different rhythmic discharge patterns.},

We found that new, highly distinct configurations of place fields emerged immediately and remained stable during the septal inactivation.

  issn = {1050-9631},
  abstract = {Sharp wave-ripples (140-220 Hz) are patterns of brain activity observed in the local field potential of the hippocampus which are present during memory consolidation. As rodents switch from memory consolidation to memory encoding behaviors, cholinergic inputs to the hippocampus from neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca cause a marked reduction in ripple incidence. The mechanism for this disruption in ripple power is not fully understood. In isolated neurons, the major effect of cholinergic input on hippocampal neurons is depolarization of the membrane potential, which affects both hippocampal pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Using an existing model of ripple-frequency oscillations that includes both pyramidal neurons and interneurons (Brunel and Wang, J Neurophysiol 2003; 90:415\textendash{}30), we investigated the mechanism whereby depolarizing inputs to these neurons can affect ripple power and frequency. We observed that ripple power and frequency are maintained, as long as inputs to pyramidal neurons and interneurons are balanced. Preferential drive to pyramidal neurons or interneurons, however, affects ripple power and can disrupt ripple oscillations by pushing ripple frequency higher or lower. Thus, an imbalance in drive to pyramidal neurons and interneurons provides a means whereby cholinergic input can suppress hippocampal ripples. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the neural circuit by which locomotor activity is linked to hippocampal oscillations and neuronal firing rates is unresolved. Here we reveal a septo-hippocampal circuit mediated by glutamatergic (VGluT2(+)) neurons that is activated before locomotion onset and that controls the initiation and velocity of locomotion as well as the entrainment of theta oscillations. Moreover, via septo-hippocampal projections onto alveus/oriens interneurons, this circuit regulates feedforward inhibition of Schaffer collateral and perforant path input to CA1 pyramidal neurons in a locomotion-dependent manner. With higher locomotion speed, the increased activity of medial septal VGluT2 neurons is translated into increased axo-somatic depolarization and higher firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

We find that chemo/optogenetic activation of MSc glutamatergic neurons profoundly reduces food intake during both light and dark periods of the rodent light cycle. Furthermore, we find that selective activation of MSc glutamatergic projections in paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) reduces food intake, suggesting that MSc glutamatergic neurons suppress feeding by activating downstream neurons in the PVH. Open-field behavioral assays reveal that these neurons do not overtly affect anxiety levels and locomotion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that septal glutamatergic neurons exert anorexigenic effects by projecting to the PVH without affecting anxiety and physical activities.},

  abstract = {Rebound spiking properties of medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) stellate cells induced by inhibition may underlie their functional properties in awake behaving rats, including the temporal phase separation of distinct grid cells and differences in grid cell firing properties. We investigated rebound spiking properties using whole cell patch recording in entorhinal slices, holding cells near spiking threshold and delivering sinusoidal inputs, superimposed with realistic inhibitory synaptic inputs to test the capacity of cells to selectively respond to specific phases of inhibitory input. Stellate cells showed a specific phase range of hyperpolarizing inputs that elicited spiking, but non-stellate cells did not show phase specificity. In both cell types, the phase range of spiking output occurred between the peak and subsequent descending zero crossing of the sinusoid. The phases of inhibitory inputs that induced spikes shifted earlier as the baseline sinusoid frequency increased, while spiking output shifted to later phases. Increases in magnitude of the inhibitory inputs shifted the spiking output to earlier phases. Pharmacological blockade of h-current abolished the phase selectivity of hyperpolarizing inputs eliciting spikes. A network computational model using cells possessing similar rebound properties as found in vitro produces spatially periodic firing properties resembling grid cell firing when a simulated animal moves along a linear track. These results suggest that the ability of mEC stellate cells to fire rebound spikes in response to a specific range of phases of inhibition could support complex attractor dynamics that provide completion and separation to maintain spiking activity of specific grid cell populations.},

This review focuses on the physiological effects of acetylcholine that may influence the sensory coding of spatial dimensions relevant to behavior. In particular, the local circuit effects of acetylcholine within the cortex regulate the influence of sensory input relative to internal memory representations via presynaptic inhibition of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, and the modulation of intrinsic currents in cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In addition, circuit effects of acetylcholine regulate the dynamics of cortical circuits including oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies. These effects of acetylcholine on local circuits and network dynamics could underlie the role of acetylcholine in coding of spatial information for the performance of spatial memory tasks.},

However, it has remained unknown how ACh modulates hippocampal output. Here, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that ACh, by activating oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM) interneurons and therefore augmenting the negative-feedback regulation to the CA1 pyramidal neurons, suppresses the circuit from the hippocampal area CA1 to the deep-layer entorhinal cortex (EC). We also demonstrate, using mouse behavior studies, that the ablation of OLM interneurons specifically impairs hippocampus-dependent but not hippocampus-independent learning. These data suggest that ACh plays an important role in regulating hippocampal output to the EC by activating OLM interneurons, which is critical for the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory.},

  abstract = {Slow firing septal neurons modulate hippocampal and neocortical functions. Electrophysiologically, it is unclear whether slow firing neurons belong to a homogeneous neuronal population. To address this issue, whole-cell patch recordings and neuronal reconstructions were performed on rat brain slices containing the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB). Slow firing neurons were identified by their low firing rate at threshold (\{\textbackslash{}textless\}5 Hz) and lack of time-dependent inward rectification (Ih). Unsupervised cluster analysis was used to investigate whether slow firing neurons could be further classified into different subtypes. The parameters used for the cluster analysis included latency for first spike, slow afterhyperpolarizing potential, maximal frequency and action potential (AP) decay slope. Neurons were grouped into three major subtypes. The majority of neurons (55\%) were grouped as cluster I. Cluster II (17\% of neurons) exhibited longer latency for generation of the first action potential (246.5{$\pm$}20.1 ms). Cluster III (28\% of neurons) exhibited higher maximal firing frequency (25.3{$\pm$}1.7 Hz) when compared with cluster I (12.3{$\pm$}0.9 Hz) and cluster II (11.8{$\pm$}1.1 Hz) neurons. Additionally, cluster III neurons exhibited faster action potentials at suprathreshold. Interestingly, cluster II neurons were frequently located in the medial septum whereas neurons in cluster I and III appeared scattered throughout all MS/DB regions. Sholl's analysis revealed a more complex dendritic arborization in cluster III neurons. Cluster I and II neurons exhibited characteristics of ``true'' slow firing neurons whereas cluster III neurons exhibited higher frequency firing patterns. Several neurons were labeled with a cholinergic marker, Cy3-conjugated 192 IgG (p75NTR), and cholinergic neurons were found to be distributed among the three clusters. Our findings indicate that slow firing medial septal neurons are heterogeneous and that soma location is an important determinant of their electrophysiological properties. Thus, slow firing neurons from different septal regions have distinct functional properties, most likely related to their diverse connectivity.},

  abstract = {Long-range glutamatergic and GABAergic projections participate in temporal coordination of neuronal activity in distributed cortical areas. In the hippocampus, GABAergic neurons project to the medial septum and retrohippocampal areas. Many GABAergic projection cells express somatostatin (SOM+) and, together with locally terminating SOM+ bistratified and O-LM cells, contribute to dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. We tested the hypothesis that diversity in SOM+ cells reflects temporal specialization during behavior using extracellular single cell recording and juxtacellular neurobiotin-labeling in freely moving rats. We have demonstrated that rare GABAergic projection neurons discharge rhythmically and are remarkably diverse. During sharp wave-ripples, most projection cells, including a novel SOM+ GABAergic back-projecting cell, increased their activity similar to bistratified cells, but unlike O-LM cells. During movement, most projection cells discharged along the descending slope of theta cycles, but some fired at the trough jointly with bistratified and O-LM cells. The specialization of hippocampal SOM+ projection neurons complements the action of local interneurons in differentially phasing inputs from the CA3 area to CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites during sleep and wakefulness. Our observations suggest that GABAergic projection cells mediate the behavior- and network state-dependent binding of neuronal assemblies amongst functionally-related brain regions by transmitting local rhythmic entrainment of neurons in CA1 to neuronal populations in other areas. \&\#xA9; 2016 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  title = {Theta-Modulation Drives the Emergence of Network-Wide Connectivity Patterns Underlying Replay in a a Model of Hippocampal Place Cells},
  abstract = {Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as "replays". It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are "transferred" from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.},

In contrast, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic fiber terminals in hippocampal slices elicited weak postsynaptic responses in hippocampal neurons. In the in vitro septo-hippocampal preparation, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons did increase the rhythmicity of hippocampal theta oscillations, whereas stimulation of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic fibers in the fornix did not have an effect. In freely behaving mice, activation of these neurons in the MS-DBB strongly synchronized hippocampal theta rhythms over a wide range of frequencies, whereas activation of their projections to the hippocampus through fornix stimulations had no effect on theta rhythms, suggesting that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons played a role in theta generation through local modulation of septal neurons. Together, these results provide the first evidence that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons modulate local septal circuits, which in turn contribute to theta rhythms in the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Reversible inactivation of the medial septal area results in a spatial memory impairment and selective disruption of hilar/CA3, but not CA1, location-specific discharge. The present study examined the possibility that such septal deafferentation produces effects on hippocampal function by altering physiological properties of the primary input and output structures for hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex and the subiculum, respectively. Single unit activity of hippocampal, entorhinal, and subicular cells was recorded before, during, and after septal injection of lidocaine in anesthetized rats. When compared to hippocampal cells, relatively few subicular and entorhinal cells showed a change in mean firing rate following septal inactivation. Entorhinal unit responses to septal inactivation (via tetracaine injection) were also examined in freely moving rats performing a spatial maze task. About one-third of entorhinal cells showed enhanced or reduced firing rates of 40\% or more. Also, the spatial distribution of cells found in the superficial, but not deep, entorhinal layers became less clear following septal inactivation. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that manipulation of the medial septum affects hippocampal function via its septosubicular and septoentorhinal projections in addition to the more direct septohippocampal pathway. Since entorhinal cortical function was affected by tetracaine injection into the septum, it does not appear that direct entorhinal-CA1 afferents were primarily responsible for the maintenance of CA1 location-specific neural activity in previous septal inactivation experiments. Rather, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the persistence of CA1 place fields was accomplished by intrahippocampal neural network operations.},

Extracellularly recording and labeling GABAergic entorhinal-projecting neurons in awake behaving mice show that these subcortical neurons, named orchid cells, fire in long rhythmic bursts during immobility and locomotion. Orchid cells discharge near the peak of hippocampal and entorhinal theta oscillations, couple to entorhinal gamma oscillations, and target subpopulations of extra-hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Thus, orchid cells are a specialized source of rhythmic subcortical GABAergic modulation of 'upstream' and 'downstream' cortico-cortical circuits involved in mnemonic functions.},

  abstract = {Recognition memory requires processing of various types of information such as objects and locations. Impairment in recognition memory is a prominent feature of amnesia and a symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons contain two major groups, one localized in the medial septum (MS)/vertical diagonal band of Broca (vDB), and the other in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). The roles of these cell groups in recognition memory have been debated, and it remains unclear how they contribute to it. We use a genetic cell targeting technique to selectively eliminate cholinergic cell groups and then test spatial and object recognition memory through different behavioural tasks. Eliminating MS/vDB neurons impairs spatial but not object recognition memory in the reference and working memory tasks, whereas NBM elimination undermines only object recognition memory in the working memory task. These impairments are restored by treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, anti-dementia drugs for AD. Our results highlight that MS/vDB and NBM cholinergic neurons are not only implicated in recognition memory but also have essential roles in different types of recognition memory.},

To understand how cholinergic neurotransmission can modulate behavior, research has been directed toward identification of the specific cellular mechanisms in EC that can be modulated through cholinergic activity. This review focuses on intrinsic cellular properties of neurons in EC that may underlie functions such as working memory, spatial processing, and episodic memory. In particular, the study of stellate cells (SCs) in medial entorhinal has resulted in discovery of correlations between physiological properties of these neurons and properties of the unique spatial representation that is demonstrated through unit recordings of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) from awake-behaving animals. A separate line of investigation has demonstrated persistent firing behavior among neurons in EC that is enhanced by cholinergic activity and could underlie working memory. There is also evidence that acetylcholine plays a role in modulation of synaptic transmission that could also enhance mnemonic function in EC. Finally, the local circuits of EC demonstrate a variety of interneuron physiology, which is also subject to cholinergic modulation. Together these effects alter the dynamics of EC to underlie the functional role of acetylcholine in memory.},

Exploratory behavior plays a fundamental role in motivation, learning, and well-being of organisms. Diverse exploratory behaviors have been described, although their heterogeneity is not certain because of the lack of solid experimental evidence for their distinction. Here we present results demonstrating that different neural mechanisms underlie different exploratory behaviors. Localized Cav3.1 knockdown in the medial septum (MS) selectively enhanced object exploration, whereas the null mutant (KO) mice showed enhanced-object exploration as well as open-field exploration. In MS knockdown mice, only type 2 hippocampal theta rhythm was enhanced, whereas both type 1 and type 2 theta rhythm were enhanced in KO mice. This selective effect was accompanied by markedly increased excitability of septo-hippocampal GABAergic projection neurons in the MS lacking T-type Ca(2+) channels. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the septo-hippocampal GABAergic pathway in WT mice also selectively enhanced object exploration behavior and type 2 theta rhythm, whereas inhibition of the same pathway decreased the behavior and the rhythm. These findings define object exploration distinguished from open-field exploration and reveal a critical role of T-type Ca(2+) channels in the medial septal GABAergic projection neurons in this behavior.},

The different populations of medial septal neurons (cholinergic and GABAergic) are assumed to affect different aspects of theta oscillations. Using optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons in ChAT-Cre mice, we investigated their effects on hippocampal local field potentials in both anesthetized and behaving mice. Cholinergic stimulation completely blocked sharp wave ripples and strongly suppressed the power of both slow oscillations (0.5-2 Hz in anesthetized, 0.5-4 Hz in behaving animals) and supratheta (6-10 Hz in anesthetized, 10-25 Hz in behaving animals) bands. The same stimulation robustly increased both the power and coherence of theta oscillations (2-6 Hz) in urethane-anesthetized mice. In behaving mice, cholinergic stimulation was less effective in the theta (4-10 Hz) band yet it also increased the ratio of theta/slow oscillation and theta coherence. The effects on gamma oscillations largely mirrored those of theta. These findings show that medial septal cholinergic activation can both enhance theta rhythm and suppress peri-theta frequency bands, allowing theta oscillations to dominate.},

Galanin impairs acquisition and/or retention of the Morris water task, delayed nonmatching to position, T-maze delayed alternation, starburst radial maze, and passive avoidance in normal rats. A primary site of action is the ventral hippocampus, with an additional modulatory site in the medial septum-diagonal band. The behavioral actions of galanin at rat septohippocampal sites mediating cognitive processes are consistent with previous reports of inhibitory actions of galanin on acetylcholine release and cholinergically activated transduction at the M1 muscarinic receptor in rat hippocampus. The peptidergic galanin receptor antagonist M40 blocks the inhibitory actions of galanin on memory tasks. Treatment combinations of M40 with an M1 agonist, TZTP, improves performance on delayed nonmatching to position, in rats with 192IgG-saporin-induced cholinergic lesions of basal forebrain neurons. Nonpeptide, bioavailable, subtype-selective galanin receptor antagonists may provide tools to test the hypothesis that antagonism of endogenous galanin, which is overexpressed in the basal forebrain in Alzheimer's patients, can contribute to the alleviation of the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons.

The existence of noncholinergic, non-GABAergic, most likely glutamatergic septal neurons has recently been reported. However, their morphological characteristics, numbers, distribution, and connectivity have not been determined. Furthermore, the projection of septal glutamatergic neurons to the hippocampus has not been characterized. To address these issues, subpopulations of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was injected into the hippocampus to determine the characteristics of a glutamatergic septo-hippocampal projection. Our work revealed that although glutamatergic neurons are found throughout the septum, they concentrate in medial septal regions. Using stereological probes, approximately 16,000 glutamatergic neurons were estimated in the medial septal region. Triple immunostaining showed that most glutamatergic neurons do not immunoreact with cholinergic or GABAergic neuronal markers (anti-ChAT or anti-GAD67 antibodies, respectively). Fluorogold injections into CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that septal glutamatergic neurons project to each of these hippocampal regions, forming {$\sim$}23\% of the septo-hippocampal projection. Most cell bodies of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic neurons were located in the medial septum. The remaining cell bodies were found in the diagonal band. This data shows that glutamatergic neurons constitute a significant neuronal population in the septum and that a subpopulation of these neurons projects to hippocampal regions.

We found that activation of these endogenous cholinergic inputs can directly induce different forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity with a timing precision in the millisecond range. Furthermore, we observed a prolonged enhancement of excitability both pre- and postsynaptically. Lastly we found that the presence of the {$\alpha$}7 nAChR subtype to both pre- and postsynaptic sites appeared to be required to induce this plasticity.

Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in EC. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and II (LI and LII). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in LI and LII of both medial and lateral EC. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}3\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sub\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic GABAergic inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease GABA alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral EC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EC activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of LI and LII neurons by the septal cholinergic system.},

  abstract = {Septo-hippocampal GABAergic neurons immunoreactive for parvalbumin are thought to play a crucial role in the generation of hippocampal theta oscillations associated with a specific stage of memory formation. Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that GABAergic medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178 degrees ) or the peak (330 degrees ) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.},

The classical feedback-inhibitory HIPPs distribute axon fibers in the molecular layer. They are engaged by converging GC-inputs and provide dendritic inhibition to the DG circuitry. In contrast, SOMIs with axon in the hilus, termed hilar interneurons (HILs), provide perisomatic inhibition onto GABAergic cells in the DG and project to the medial septum. Repetitive activation of glutamatergic inputs onto HIPP cells induces long-lasting-depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission but long-term-potentiation (LTP) of synaptic signals in HIL cells. Thus, LTD in HIPPs may assist flow of spatial information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG, whereas LTP in HILs may facilitate the temporal coordination of GCs with activity patterns governed by the medial septum.},

Neurons of these three classes project to glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and different subsets of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. From there, GABAergic neurons project back to the medial septum and form a feedback loop between the two remote brain areas. In vivo, the firing of GABAergic medial septal neurons is theta modulated, while theta modulation is not observed in cholinergic neurons. One prominent feature of glutamatergic neurons is the correlation of their firing rates to the animals running speed. The cellular diversity, the high local interconnectivity and different activity patterns of medial septal neurons during different behaviors complicate the functional dissection of this network. New technical advances help to define specific functions of individual cell classes.

  abstract = {The present study explored the functional details of the influence of medial septal region (MSDB) on spectrum of nociceptive behaviours by manipulating intraseptal GABAergic mechanisms. Results showed that formalin-induced acute nociception was not affected by intraseptal microinjection of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, or on selective lesion of septal GABAergic neurons. Indeed, the acute nociceptive responses were dissociated from the regulation of sensorimotor behaviour and generation of theta-rhythm by the GABAergic mechanisms in MSDB. The GABAergic lesion attenuated formalin-induced unconditioned cellular response in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and blocked formalin-induced conditioned place avoidance (F-CPA), and as well as the contextual fear induced on conditioning with brief footshock. The effects of lesion on nociceptive-conditioned cellular responses were, however, variable. Interestingly, the lesion attenuated the conditioned representation of experimental context in dorsal hippocampus field CA1 in the F-CPA task. Collectively, the preceding suggests that the MSDB is a nodal centre wherein the GABAergic neurons mediate nociceptive affect-motivation by regulating cellular mechanisms in ACC that confer an aversive value to the noxious stimulus. Further, in conjunction with a modulatory influence on hippocampal contextual processing, MSDB may integrate affect with context as part of associative learning in the F-CPA task.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1662-5110},
  abstract = {Oscillations in the coordinated firing of brain neurons have been proposed to play important roles in perception, cognition, attention, learning, navigation, and sensory-motor control. The network theta rhythm has been associated with properties of spatial navigation, as has the firing of entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells. Two recent studies reduced the theta rhythm by inactivating the medial septum (MS) and demonstrated a correlated reduction in the characteristic hexagonal spatial firing patterns of grid cells. These results, along with properties of intrinsic membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) in slice preparations of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), have been interpreted to support oscillatory interference models of grid cell firing. The current article shows that an alternative self-organizing map (SOM) model of grid cells can explain these data about intrinsic and network oscillations without invoking oscillatory interference. In particular, the adverse effects of MS inactivation on grid cells can be understood in terms of how the concomitant reduction in cholinergic inputs may increase the conductances of leak potassium (K(+)) and slow and medium after-hyperpolarization (sAHP and mAHP) channels. This alternative model can also explain data that are problematic for oscillatory interference models, including how knockout of the HCN1 gene in mice, which flattens the dorsoventral gradient in MPO frequency and resonance frequency, does not affect the development of the grid cell dorsoventral gradient of spatial scales, and how hexagonal grid firing fields in bats can occur even in the absence of theta band modulation. These results demonstrate how models of grid cell self-organization can provide new insights into the relationship between brain learning and oscillatory dynamics.},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus (Hipp) are critical for extinction memory. Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic input to the vmPFC and Hipp is critical for neural function in these substrates, which suggests BF cholinergic neurons may be critical for extinction memory. In order to test this hypothesis, we applied cholinergic lesions to different regions of the BF and observed the effects these lesions had on extinction memory. Complete BF cholinergic lesions induced contextual fear memory generalization, and this generalized fear was resistant to extinction. Animals with complete BF cholinergic lesions could not acquire cued fear extinction. Restricted cholinergic lesions in the medial septum and vertical diagonal bands of Broca (MS/vDBB) mimicked the effects that BF cholinergic lesions had on contextual fear memory generalization and acquisition of fear extinction. Cholinergic lesions in the horizontal diagonal band of Broca and nucleus basalis (hDBB/NBM) induced a small deficit in extinction of generalized contextual fear memory with no accompanying deficits in cued fear extinction. The results of this study reveal that MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons are critical for inhibition and extinction of generalized contextual fear memory, and via this process, may be critical for acquisition of cued fear extinction. Further studies delineating neural circuits and mechanisms through which MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons facilitate these emotional memory processes are needed. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Optogenetic stimulation was applied to the medial septum glutamatergic neurons to modulate the hippocampal neural activity in a rat tetanus toxin seizure model. The hippocampal local field potential was recorded using a multi electrode array in an awake and behaving rat. Optical stimulation with a 465nm light source was applied at 35Hz in a 20 seconds off / 20 seconds on pattern with simultaneous recording from the hippocampus. Both the baseline and the stimulation period recordings were divided into 2 second segments and used for the further analysis. In the first experiment, a support vector machine (SVM) model classified the neural states by using spectral features between 0 and 50Hz. 447 out of 545 segments (82.02\%) were correctly labeled as `Baseline' while only 326 out of 544 (59.93\%) segments from the stimulation period were correctly labeled as `Stimulation.' As the ratio of mislabels is significantly higher for the stimulation period (chi-squared, p\&lt;;0.01), we concluded that the stimulation was not always effective. In the second experiment, an SVM model predicted the stimulation effectiveness using the spectral features of the pre-stimulation segments. The classification result shows that 63.7\% of the pre-stimulation segments correctly predicted the stimulation effectiveness. These findings suggest that the prediction of the stimulation effectiveness may improve the stimulation efficacy by implementing a state-based stimulation protocol.},

  abstract = {The medial septum (MS) plays an essential role in rhythmogenesis in the hippocampus (HIPP); theta-rhythmic bursts of MS neurons are believed to drive theta oscillations in rats' HIPP. The MS theta pacemaker hypothesis has solid foundation but the MS-hippocampal interactions during different behavioral states are poorly understood. The MS and the HIPP have reciprocal connections and it is not clear in particular what role, if any, the strong HIPP to MS projection plays in theta generation. To study the functional interactions between MS and HIPP during different behavioral states, this study investigated the relationship between MS single-unit activity and HIPP field potential oscillations during theta states of active waking and REM sleep and non-theta states of slow wave sleep (SWS) and quiet waking (QW), i.e., sleep-wake states that comprise the full behavioral repertoire of undisturbed, freely moving rats. We used non-parametric Granger causality (GC) to decompose the MS-HIPP synchrony into its directional components, MS\&\#x2192;HIPP and HIPP\&\#x2192;MS, and to examine the causal interactions between them within the theta frequency band. We found a significant unidirectional MS\&\#x2192;HIPP influence in non-theta states which switches to bidirectional theta drive during theta states with MS\&\#x2192;HIPP and HIPP\&\#x2192;MS GC being of equal magnitude. In non-theta states, unidirectional MS\&\#x2192;HIPP influence was accompanied by significant MS-HIPP coherence, but no signs of theta oscillations in the HIPP. In theta states of active waking and REM sleep, sharp theta coherence and strong theta power in both structures was associated with a rise in HIPP\&\#x2192;MS to the level of the MS\&\#x2192;HIPP drive. Thus, striking differences between waking and REM sleep theta states and non-theta states of SWS and QW were primarily observed in activation of theta influence carried by the descending HIPP\&\#x2192;MS pathway associated with more regular rhythmic bursts in the MS and sharper MS\&\#x2192;HIPP GC spectra without a significant increase in MS\&\#x2192;HIPP GC magnitude.

  abstract = {It is widely believed that the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is caused by the rhythmic input from the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MSDB). The main MSDB output is formed by GABAergic projection neurons which are divided into two subpopulations and fire at different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The MSDB also contains projection cholinergic, glutamatergic, and non-projection GABAergic neurons. These cell populations innervate each other and also GABAergic projection neurons and participate in the formation of the synchronous rhythmic output to the hippocampus. The purpose of this study is to work out a model of interactions between all neural populations of the MSDB that underlie the formation of the synchronous septal theta signal. The model is built from biologically plausible neurons of the Hodgkin-Huxley type and its architecture reflects modern data on the morphology of neural connections in the MSDB. The model satisfies the following requirements: (1) a large portion of neurons is fast-spiking; (2) the subpopulations of GABAergic projection neurons contain endogenous pacemaker neurons; (3) the phase shift of activity between subpopulations of GABAergic projection neurons is equal to about 150\&\#xB0;; and (4) the strengths of bidirectional connections between the subpopulations of GABAergic projection cells are different. It is shown that the theta rhythm generation can be performed by a system of glutamatergic and GABAergic non-projection neurons. We also show that bursting pacemaker neurons in the subpopulation of projection GABAergic neurons play a significant role in the formation of stable antiphase outputs from the MSDB to the hippocampus.},

To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of optogenetic stimulation for altering hippocampal oscillations in freely moving wild-type rats, or how these alterations would affect performance on behavioral tasks. Here, we used an AAV virus to express ChR2 in the medial septum (MS) of wild-type rats, and optically stimulated septal neurons at 6\&\#xA0;Hz and 30\&\#xA0;Hz. We measured the corresponding effects of these stimulations on the oscillations of the MS and hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 in three different contexts: (1) With minimal movement while the rats sat in a confined chamber; (2) Explored a novel open field; and (3) Learned and performed a T-maze behavioral task. While control yellow light stimulation did not affect oscillations, 6-Hz blue light septal stimulations altered hippocampal theta oscillations in a manner that depended on the animal's mobility and speed. While the 30 Hz blue light septal stimulations only altered theta frequency in CA1 while the rat had limited mobility, it robustly increased the amplitude of hippocampal signals at 30\&\#xA0;Hz in both regions in all three recording contexts. We found that animals were more likely to make a correct choice during Day 1 of T-maze training during both MS stimulation protocols than during control stimulation, and that improved performance was independent of theta frequency alterations.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal network oscillations are important for learning and memory. Theta rhythms are involved in attention, navigation, and memory encoding, whereas sharp wave-ripple complexes are involved in memory consolidation. Cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DB) influence both types of hippocampal oscillations, promoting theta rhythms and suppressing sharp wave-ripples. They also receive frequency-dependent hyperpolarizing feedback from hippocamposeptal connections, potentially affecting their role as neuromodulators in the septohippocampal circuit. However, little is known about how the integration properties of cholinergic MS-DB neurons change with hyperpolarization. By potentially altering firing behavior in cholinergic neurons, hyperpolarizing feedback from the hippocampal neurons may, in turn, change hippocampal network activity. To study changes in membrane integration properties in cholinergic neurons in response to hyperpolarizing inputs, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings targeting genetically labeled, choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in mouse brain slices. Hyperpolarization of cholinergic MS-DB neurons resulted in a long-lasting decrease in spike firing rate and input-output gain. Additionally, voltage-clamp measures implicated a slowly inactivating, 4-AP-insensitive, outward K\{\textbackslash{}textless\}sup\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\}+\{\textbackslash{}textless\}/sup\{\textbackslash{}textgreater\} conductance. Using a conductance-based model of cholinergic MS-DB neurons, we show that the ability of this conductance to modulate firing rate and gain depends on the expression of an experimentally verified shallow intrinsic spike frequency-voltage relationship. Together, these findings point to a means through which negative feedback from hippocampal neurons can influence the role of cholinergic MS-DB neurons. \&\#xA9; 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To investigate whether MS neurons innervate specific layers and cell types in the MEC, we expressed channelrhodopsin-2 in mouse MS neurons and used patch-clamp recording in brain slices to determine the response to light activation of identified cells in the MEC. Following activation of MS axons, we observed fast monosynaptic GABAergic IPSPs in the majority (\&gt;60\%) of fast-spiking (FS) and low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in all layers of the MEC, but in only 1.5\% of nonstellate principal cells (NSPCs) and in no stellate cells. We also observed fast glutamatergic responses to MS activation in a minority (\&lt;5\%) of NSPCs, FS, and LTS interneurons. During stimulation of MS inputs at theta frequency (10 Hz), the amplitude of GABAergic IPSPs was maintained, and spike output from LTS and FS interneurons was entrained at low (25-60 Hz) and high (60-180 Hz) gamma frequencies, respectively. By demonstrating cell type-specific targeting of the GABAergic projection from the MS to the MEC, our results support the idea that the MS controls theta frequency activity in the MEC through coordination of inhibitory circuits.},

Because both SPW and the negative peak of local theta waves correspond to the maximum discharge probability of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneuron classes, the findings indicate that the activity of medial septal neurons can be negatively (during SPW) or positively (during theta waves) correlated with the activity of hippocampal interneurons. We hypothesize that the functional coupling between medial septal neurons and hippocampal interneurons varies in a state-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {Several cortical and diencephalic limbic brain regions incorporate neurons that fire in correlation with the speed of whole-body motion, also known as linear velocity. Besides the field mapping and head-directional information, the linear velocity is among the major signals that guide animal's spatial navigation. Large neuronal populations in the same limbic regions oscillate with theta rhythm during spatial navigation or attention episodes; and the frequency of theta also correlates with linear velocity. A functional similarity between these brain areas is that their inactivation impairs the ability to form new spatial memories; whereas an anatomical similarity is that they all receive projections from medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. We review recent findings supporting the model that septal theta rhythm integrates different sensorimotor signals necessary for spatial navigation. The medial septal is described here as a circuitry that mediates experience-dependent balance of sustained attention and path integration during navigation. We discuss the hypothesis that theta rhythm serves as a key mechanism for the aligning of intrinsic spatial representation to: (1) rapid change of position in the spatial environment; (2) continuous alteration of sensory signals throughout navigation; and (3) adapting levels of attentional behavior. The synchronization of these spatial, somatosensory and neuromodulatory signals is proposed here to be anatomically and physiologically mediated by the medial septum.},

  abstract = {The hippocampal circuitry undergoes attentional modulation by the cholinergic medial septum. However, it is unclear how septal activation regulates the spatial properties of hippocampal neurons. We investigated here what is the functional effect of selective-cholinergic and non-selective septal stimulation on septo-hippocampal system. We show for the first time selective activation of cholinergic cells and their differential network effect in medial septum of freely-behaving transgenic rats. Our data show that depolarization of cholinergic septal neurons evokes frequency-dependent response from the non-cholinergic septal neurons and hippocampal interneurons. Our findings provide vital evidence that cholinergic effect on septo-hippocampal axis is behavior-dependent. During the active behavioral state the activation of septal cholinergic projections is insufficient to evoke significant change in the spiking of the hippocampal neurons. The efficiency of septo-hippocampal processing during active exploration relates to the firing patterns of the non-cholinergic theta-bursting cells. Non-selective septal theta-burst stimulation resets the spiking of hippocampal theta cells, increases theta synchronization, entrains the spiking of hippocampal place cells, and tunes the spatial properties in a timing-dependent manner. The spatial properties are augmented only when the stimulation is applied in the periphery of the place field or 400-650 ms before the animals approached the center of the field. In summary, our data show that selective cholinergic activation triggers a robust network effect in the septo-hippocampal system during inactive behavioral state, whereas the non-cholinergic septal activation regulates hippocampal functional properties during explorative behavior. Together, our findings uncover fast septal modulation on hippocampal network and reveal how septal inputs up-regulate and down-regulate the encoding of spatial representation.},

We asked how well identification of neurons by conventional measures of intrinsic excitability compares with a measure of neuronal excitability derived from a neuron's behavior in a dynamic clamp constructed two-cell network. We used four cell types from the crab stomatogastric ganglion: the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, gastric mill, and dorsal gastric neurons. Each neuron was evaluated for six conventional measures of intrinsic excitability (intrinsic properties, IPs). Additionally, each neuron was coupled by reciprocal inhibitory synapses made with the dynamic clamp to a Morris\textendash{}Lecar model neuron and the resulting network was assayed for four measures of network activity (network activity properties, NAPs). We searched for linear combinations of IPs that correlated with each NAP, and combinations of NAPs that correlated with each IP. In the process we developed a method to correct for multiple correlations while searching for correlating features. When properly controlled for multiple correlations, four of the IPs were correlated with NAPs, and all four NAPs were correlated with IPs. Neurons were classified into cell types by training a linear classifier on sets of properties, or using k -medoids clustering.The IPs were modestly successful in classifying the neurons, and the NAPs were more successful. Combining the two measures did better than either measure alone, but not well enough to classify neurons with perfect accuracy, thus reiterating that electrophysiological measures of single-cell properties alone are not sufficient for reliable cell identification.},

Although all of the vectors contained the same genome, there were markedly different transduction patterns that could be due only to the differences in capsid proteins. The AAV 9 vector was found to undergo vector genome transport to distal neuronal cell bodies via known axonal pathways. This facilitated the distribution of enzyme, resulting in correction of lysosomal storage lesions in regions of a diseased brain that would not be corrected if the genome were not transported.},

We report here a direct interaction between voltage-gated Ca2؉ channels and endophilin, a key regulator of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Formation of the endophlin-Ca2؉ channel complex is Ca2؉ dependent. The primary Ca2؉ binding domain resides within endophilin and regulates both endophilin-Ca2؉ channel and endophilin-dynamin complexes. Introduction into hippocampal neurons of a dominant-negative endophilin construct, which constitutively binds to Ca2؉ channels, significantly reduces endocytosis-mediated uptake of FM 4-64 dye without abolishing exocytosis. These results suggest an important role for Ca2؉ channels in coordinating synaptic vesicle recycling by directly coupling to both exocytotic and endocytic machineries.},

Transmitter release takes places at highly specialized active zones with submicrometer dimension, which contain the molecular machinery for vesicle docking and -fusion, as well as a high density of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In the absence of direct evidence for the ultrastructural localization of Ca2+ channels at CNS synapses, important insights into Ca2+ channel\textendash{}vesicle coupling has come from functional experiments relating presynaptic Ca2+ current and transmitter release, at large and accessible synapses like the calyx of Held. First, high slope values in log\textendash{}log plots of transmitter release versus presynaptic Ca2+ current indicate that multiple Ca2+ channels are involved in release control of a single vesicle. Second, release kinetics in response to step-like depolarizations revealed fast- and slowly releasable sub-pools of vesicles, FRP and SRP, which, according to the ``positional'' model, are distinguished by a differential proximity to Ca2+ channels. Considering recent evidence for a rapid conversion of SRP- to FRP vesicles, however, we highlight that multivesicular release events and clearance of vesicle membrane from the active zone must be taken into account when interpreting kinetic release data. We conclude that the careful kinetic analysis of transmitter release at presynaptically accessible and molecularly targeted synapses has the potential to yield important insights into the molecular physiology of transmitter release.},

It was presumed that two other forms of exocytosis, delayed (asynchronous) and spontaneous transmission, were mediated by the same voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs), intracellular Ca2+ sensors and vesicle pools. However, a recent explosion in the study of spontaneous and asynchronous release has shown these presumptions to be incorrect. Furthermore, the finding that different forms of synaptic transmission may mediate distinct physiological functions emphasizes the importance of identifying the mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates spontaneous and asynchronous release. In this article, we will briefly summarize new and published data on the role of Ca2+ in regulating spontaneous and asynchronous release at a number of different synapses. We will discuss how an increase of extracellular [Ca2+] increases spontaneous and asynchronous release, show that VACCs are involved at only some synapses, and identify regulatory roles for other ion channels and G proteincoupled receptors. In particular, we will focus on two novel pathways that play important roles in the regulation of non-synchronous release at two exemplary synapses: one modulated by the Ca2+-sensing receptor and the other by transient receptor potential cation channel sub-family V member 1.},

Reelin signaling induces phosphorylation of LIM kinase 1, which phosphorylates the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin in migrating neurons. Conditional cofilin mutants show neuronal migration defects. Thus, both reelin and cofilin are indispensable during cortical development. To analyze the effects of cofilin phosphorylation on neuronal migration we used in utero electroporation to transfect E14.5 wild-type cortical neurons with pCAG-EGFP plasmids encoding either a nonphosphorylatable form of cofilin 1 (cofilinS3A), a pseudophosphorylated form (cofilinS3E) or wild-type cofilin 1 (cofilinWT). Wild-type controls and reeler neurons were transfected with pCAG-EGFP. Real-time microscopy and histological analyses revealed that overexpression of cofilinWT and both phosphomutants induced migration defects and morphological abnormalities of cortical neurons. Of note, reeler neurons and cofilinS3A- and cofilinS3E-transfected neurons showed aberrant backward migration towards the ventricular zone. Overexpression of cofilinS3E, the pseudophosphorylated form, partially rescued the migration defect of reeler neurons, as did overexpression of Limk1. Collectively, the results indicate that reelin and cofilin cooperate in controlling cytoskeletal dynamics during neuronal migration.},

Of the tested olfactory sensory neurons,12\% responded to the odorant cineole with an inward current. Caged compounds were introduced into the cytoplasm through the patch pipette and flash photolysis of caged cyclic nucleotides activated an inward current in 94\% of the cells. When the flash was localized at the cilia, the response latency, rising time and duration were shorter than when the flash illuminated the soma. The amplitude of the photolysis response was dependent on light intensity and the relation was fitted by the Hill equation, with a Hill coefficient of 3.2.

Yet how the various steps, from transporting synaptic components to adhering synaptic partners and assembling the synaptic structure, are regulated and precisely executed during development and maintenance is still unclear. With the improvement of imaging and molecular tools, recent work in vertebrate and invertebrate systems has provided important insight into various aspects of presynaptic development, maintenance, and trans-synaptic signals, thereby increasing our understanding of how extrinsic organizers and intracellular mechanisms contribute to presynapse formation.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {2050-084X},
  abstract = {Biophysical properties of neurons become increasingly diverse over development, but mechanisms underlying and constraining this diversity are not fully understood. Here we investigate electrophysiological characteristics of Xenopus tadpole midbrain neurons across development and during homeostatic plasticity induced by patterned visual stimulation. We show that in development tectal neuron properties not only change on average, but also become increasingly diverse. After sensory stimulation, both electrophysiological diversity and functional differentiation of cells are reduced. At the same time, the amount of cross-correlations between cell properties increase after patterned stimulation as a result of homeostatic plasticity. We show that tectal neurons with similar spiking profiles often have strikingly different electrophysiological properties, and demonstrate that changes in intrinsic excitability during development and in response to sensory stimulation are mediated by different underlying mechanisms. Overall, this analysis and the accompanying dataset provide a unique framework for further studies of network maturation in Xenopus tadpoles.
          , 
            Brains consist of many cells called neurons: billions of them in a human brain, and hundreds of thousands in the brain of a small fish or a frog tadpole. Many of these neurons are very much alike, and work together to process information in the brain. Yet while they are similar, they are not exactly identical. One of the reasons for these differences seems to be to allow each neuron to contribute something unique to the overall working of the brain. By looking at how individual neurons within a specific type differ from each other, it is possible to understand more about how they work together.
            Ciarleglio, Khakhalin et al. have now compared the properties of the neurons in a part of the brain of a developing frog tadpole that processes sensory information. This showed that these neurons appear relatively similar to each other in young tadpoles. However, as the tadpoles grow and their brains become more elaborate the neurons become increasingly diverse, and their properties become more unique and nuanced.
            One possible explanation is that this diversity reflects new types of neurons being formed; another, that the differences between the neurons reflect how these cells have adapted to different patterns of sensory input they may have experienced. To distinguish between these two possibilities, Ciarleglio, Khakhalin et al. provided a group of older tadpoles with strobe-like visual stimulation and observed that this caused the neurons to become more similar once again. This suggests that neurons can change their response properties to adapt to the type of sensory input they receive, which would allow the animal to better process different types of sensory information. The data collected through these experiments could now be used to build computational models of this part of the tadpole brain.},

  abstract = {Brain rhythms are nearly always analyzed in the spectral domain in terms of their power, phase, and frequency. While this conventional approach has uncovered spike-field coupling, as well as correlations to normal behaviors and pathological states, emerging work has highlighted the physiological and behavioral importance of multiple novel oscillation features. Oscillatory bursts, for example, uniquely index a variety of cognitive states, and the nonsinusoidal shape of oscillations relate to physiological changes, including Parkinson's disease. Open questions remain regarding how bursts and nonsinusoidal features relate to circuit-level processes, and how they interrelate. By analyzing unit and local field recordings in the rodent hippocampus, we uncover a number of significant relationships between oscillatory bursts, nonsinusoidal waveforms, and local inhibitory and excitatory spiking patterns. Bursts of theta oscillations are surprisingly related to a decrease in pyramidal neuron synchrony, and have no detectable effect on firing sequences, despite significant increases in neuronal firing rates during periods of theta bursting. Theta burst duration is predicted by the asymmetries of its first cycle, and cycle asymmetries relate to firing rate, synchrony, and sequences of pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These results provide compelling physiological evidence that time-domain features, of both nonsinusoidal hippocampal theta waveform and the theta bursting state, reflects local circuit properties. These results point to the possibility of inferring circuit states from local field potential features in the hippocampus and perhaps other brain regions with other rhythms.},

To establish the generality of this approach, we present translational profiles for 24 CNS cell populations and identify known cell-specific and enriched transcripts for each population. We report thousands of cell-specific mRNAs that were not detected in whole-tissue microarray studies and provide examples that demonstrate the benefits deriving from comparative analysis. To provide a foundation for further biological and in silico studies, we provide a resource of 16 transgenic mouse lines, their corresponding anatomic characterization, and translational profiles for cell types from a variety of central nervous system structures. This resource will enable a wide spectrum of molecular and mechanistic studies of both well-known and previously uncharacterized neural cell populations.},

  abstract = {Forward genetic studies have identified several chloride (Cl-) channel genes, including CFTR, ClC-2, ClC-3, CLCA, Bestrophin, and Ano1, in the heart. Recent reverse genetic studies using gene targeting and transgenic techniques to delineate the functional role of cardiac Cl- channels have shown that Cl- channels may contribute to cardiac arrhythmogenesis, myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure, and cardioprotection against ischemia reperfusion. The study of physiological or pathophysiological phenotypes of cardiac Cl- channels, however, is complicated by the compensatory changes in the animals in response to the targeted genetic manipulation. Alternatively, tissue-specific conditional or inducible knockout or knockin animal models may be more valuable in the phenotypic studies of specific Cl- channels by limiting the effect of compensation on the phenotype. The integrated function of Cl- channels may involve multiprotein complexes of the Cl- channel subproteome. Similar phenotypes can be attained from alternative protein pathways within cellular networks, which are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The phenomics approach, which characterizes phenotypes as a whole phenome and systematically studies the molecular changes that give rise to particular phenotypes achieved by modifying the genotype under the scope of genome/proteome/phenome, may provide more complete understanding of the integrated function of each cardiac Cl- channel in the context of health and disease.

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {A major source of random variability in cortical networks is the quasi-random arrival of presynaptic action potentials from many other cells. In network studies as well as in the study of the response properties of single cells embedded in a network, synaptic background input is often approximated by Poissonian spike trains. However, the output statistics of the cells is in most cases far from being Poisson. This is inconsistent with the assumption of similar spike-train statistics for pre- and postsynaptic cells in a recurrent network. Here we tackle this problem for the popular class of integrate-and-fire neurons and study a self-consistent statistics of input and output spectra of neural spike trains. Instead of actually using a large network, we use an iterative scheme, in which we simulate a single neuron over several generations. In each of these generations, the neuron is stimulated with surrogate stochastic input that has a similar statistics as the output of the previous generation. For the surrogate input, we employ two distinct approximations: (i) a superposition of renewal spike trains with the same interspike interval density as observed in the previous generation and (ii) a Gaussian current with a power spectrum proportional to that observed in the previous generation. For input parameters that correspond to balanced input in the network, both the renewal and the Gaussian iteration procedure converge quickly and yield comparable results for the self-consistent spike-train power spectrum. We compare our results to large-scale simulations of a random sparsely connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (Brunel, 2000) and show that in the asynchronous regime close to a state of balanced synaptic input from the network, our iterative schemes provide an excellent approximations to the autocorrelation of spike trains in the recurrent network.},

            We developed a biophysically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) with over 10,000 neurons and 35 million synapses. We focused on intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons of layer 5 (L5), which were modeled at high multicompartment resolution. Wiring densities were based on prior detailed measures from mouse slice, and depended on cell class and cortical depth at sublaminar resolution. Prominent phase-amplitude-coupled delta and gamma activity emerged from the network. Spectral Granger causality analysis revealed the dynamics of information flow through populations at different frequencies. Stimulation of motor vs sensory long-range inputs to M1 demonstrated distinct intra- and inter-laminar dynamics and PT output. Manipulating PT

While neuroanatomical methods enable high-resolution mapping of neural circuitry, these approaches do not allow systematic molecular profiling of neurons based on their connectivity. Here, we report the development of an approach for molecularly profiling projective neurons. We show that ribosomes can be tagged with a camelid nanobody raised against GFP and that this system can be engineered to selectively capture translating mRNAs from neurons retrogradely labeled with GFP. Using this system, we profiled neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. We then used an AAV to selectively profile midbrain dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. By comparing the captured mRNAs from each experiment, we identified a number of markers specific to VTA dopaminergic projection neurons. The current method provides a means for profiling neurons based on their projections.},

  abstract = {Synaptic vesicle recycling is one of the best-studied cellular pathways. Many of the proteins involved are known, and their interactions are becoming increasingly clear. However, as for many other pathways, it is still difficult to understand synaptic vesicle recycling as a whole. While it is generally possible to point out how synaptic reactions take place, it is not always easy to understand what triggers or controls them. Also, it is often difficult to understand how the availability of the reaction partners is controlled: how the reaction partners manage to find each other in the right place, at the right time. I present here an overview of synaptic vesicle recycling, discussing the mechanisms that trigger different reactions, and those that ensure the availability of reaction partners. A central argument is that synaptic vesicles bind soluble cofactor proteins, with low affinity, and thus control their availability in the synapse, forming a buffer for cofactor proteins. The availability of cofactor proteins, in turn, regulates the different synaptic reactions. Similar mechanisms, in which one of the reaction partners buffers another, may apply to many other processes, from the biogenesis to the degradation of the synaptic vesicle.},

Indeed, the vesicular transport of most classical transmitters involves a mechanism of H+ exchange, which restricts flux to acidic membranes such as synaptic vesicles. However, vesicular transport of the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate depends primarily on membrane potential, which would drive non-vesicular efflux, and the role of protons is unclear. Adapting electrophysiology to record currents associated with the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), we characterize a chloride conductance that is gated by lumenal protons and chloride and supports glutamate uptake. Rather than coupling stoichiometrically to glutamate flux, lumenal protons and chloride allosterically activate vesicular glutamate transport. Gating by protons serves to inhibit what would otherwise be substantial non-vesicular glutamate efflux at the plasma membrane, thereby restricting VGLUT activity to synaptic vesicles.},

At the light microscopic level, immunoreactivity for the a1A protein was prevalent in the molecular layer, whereas immunostaining was moderate in the somata of Purkinje cells and weak in the granule cell layer. At the electron microscopic level, the most intense immunoreactivity for the a1A subunit was found in the presynaptic active zone of parallel \textregistered{}bre varicosities. The dendritic spines of Purkinje cells were also strongly labelled with the highest density of immunoparticles detected within 180 nm from the edge of the asymmetrical parallel \textregistered{}bre{$\pm$}Purkinje cell synapses.

  abstract = {The glomeruli of the main olfactory bulb are the first processing station of the olfactory pathway, where complex interactions occur between sensory axons, mitral cells and a variety of juxtaglomerular neurons, including external tufted cells (ETCs). Despite a number of studies characterizing ETCs, little is known about how their morphological and functional properties correspond to each other. Here we determined the active and passive electrical properties of ETCs using in vitro whole-cell recordings, and correlated them with their dendritic arborization patterns. Principal component followed by cluster analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations of ETCs based on their electrophysiological properties. Eight out of 12 measured physiological parameters exhibited significant difference between the two subpopulations, including the membrane time constant, amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization, variance in the interspike interval distribution and subthreshold resonance. Cluster analysis of the morphological properties of the cells also revealed two subpopulations, the most prominent dissimilarity between the groups being the presence or absence of secondary, basal dendrites. Finally, clustering the cells taking all measured properties into account also indicated the presence of two subpopulations that mapped in an almost perfect one-to-one fashion to both the physiologically and the morphologically derived groups. Our results demonstrate that a number of functional and structural properties of ETCs are highly predictive of one another. However, cells within each subpopulation exhibit pronounced variability, suggesting a large degree of specialization evolved to fulfil specific functional requirements in olfactory information processing.},

  abstract = {The mammalian olfactory epithelium contains olfactory receptor neurons and trigeminal sensory endings. The former mediate odor detection, the latter the detection of irritants. The two apparently parallel chemosensory systems are in reality interdependent in various well-documented ways. Psychophysical studies have shown that virtually all odorants can act as irritants, and that most irritants have an odor. Thus, the sensory perception of odorants and irritants is based on simultaneous input from the two systems. Moreover, functional interactions between the olfactory system and the trigeminal system exist on both peripheral and central levels. Here we examine the impact of trigeminal stimulation on the odor response of olfactory receptor neurons. Using an odorant with low trigeminal potency (phenylethyl alcohol) and a non-odorous irritant (CO2), we have explored this interaction in psychophysical experiments with human subjects and in electroolfactogram (EOG) recordings from rats. We have demonstrated that simultaneous activation of the trigeminal system attenuates the perception of odor intensity and distorts the EOG response. On the molecular level, we have identified a route for this cross-modal interaction. The neuropeptide calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), which is released from trigeminal sensory fibres upon irritant stimulation, inhibits the odor response of olfactory receptor neurons. CGRP receptors expressed by these neurons mediate this neuromodulatory effect. This study demonstrates a site of trigeminal\textendash{}olfactory interaction in the periphery. It reveals a pathway for trigeminal impact on olfactory signal processing that influences odor perception.},

  abstract = {We investigated the role of voltage-activated calcium (Cav) channels for synaptic transmission at mouse olfactory and vomeronasal nerve terminals at the first synapse of the main and accessory olfactory pathways, respectively. We provided evidence for a central role of the N-type Cav channel subunit Cav2.2 in presynaptic transmitter release at these synapses. Striking Cav2.2 immunoreactivity was localised to the glomerular neuropil of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), and co-localised with presynaptic molecules such as bassoon. Voltage-clamp recordings of sensory nerve-evoked, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in mitral/tufted (M/T) and superficial tufted cells of the MOB and mitral cells of the AOB, in combination with established subtype-specific Cav channel toxins, indicated a predominant role of N-type channels in transmitter release at these synapses, whereas L-type, P/Q-type, and R-type channels had either no or only relatively minor contributions. In Cacna1b mutant mice lacking the Cav2.2 (a1B) subunit of N-type channels, olfactory nerve-evoked M/T cell EPSCs were not reduced but became blocker-resistant, thus indicating a major reorganisation and compensation of Cav channel subunits as a result of the Cav2.2 deletion at this synapse. Cav2.2-deficient mice also revealed that Cav2.2 was critically required for pairedpulse depression of olfactory nerve-evoked EPSCs in M/T cells of the MOB, and they demonstrated an essential requirement for Cav2.2 in vomeronasal nerve-evoked EPSCs of AOB mitral cells. Thus, Cacna1b loss-of-function mutations are unlikely to cause general anosmia but Cacna1b emerges as a strong candidate in the search for mutations causing altered olfactory perception, such as changes in general olfactory sensitivity and altered social responses to chemostimuli.},

  abstract = {The amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease, interacts with the synaptic release machinery, suggesting a role in neurotransmission. Here we mapped this interaction to the NH2-terminal region of the APP intracellular domain. A peptide encompassing this binding domain -named JCasp- is naturally produced by a {$\gamma$}-secretase/caspase double-cut of APP. JCasp interferes with the APP-presynaptic proteins interaction and, if linked to a cell-penetrating peptide, reduces glutamate release in acute hippocampal slices from wild-type but not APP deficient mice, indicating that JCasp inhibits APP function.The APP-like protein-2 (APLP2) also binds the synaptic release machinery. Deletion of APP and APLP2 produces synaptic deficits similar to those caused by JCasp. Our data support the notion that APP and APLP2 facilitate transmitter release, likely through the interaction with the neurotransmitter release machinery. Given the link of APP to Alzheimer's disease, alterations of this synaptic role of APP could contribute to dementia.
          , 
            Alzheimer's disease has been linked to mutations in a gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in this gene cause early onset Alzheimer's disease in some families. Studies in animals suggest this mutant form of the protein may interfere with the messages sent between brain cells. But it remains unclear how this protein works even when it isn't mutated.
            One reason it has been difficult to figure out how APP works is because it is a long protein and is often cut into smaller, but still functional proteins. It is unclear which parts of the protein are involved in sending messages between brain cells, but previous research has allowed scientists to zero in on one stretch of the protein containing just 50 amino acids.
            Now, Fanutza, Del Prete et al. reveal that this short stretch of APP interacts with the proteins that control the release of glutamate, one of the brain's most important excitatory neurotransmitter. This stretch is cut from the full protein and released into the cell as a protein fragment (or peptide). Further experiments showed that this naturally occurring peptide interferes with the activity of APP, and in doing so reduces the release of glutamate from brain cells in mice. However, there was no effect on glutamate release when this peptide was introduced inside brain cells from mutant mice that lacked APP.
            Together, the results show that this 50-amino acid stretch of APP promotes glutamate release between brain cells, and that a peptide containing the same stretch of the protein interferes with this process. Altered glutamate neurotransmission could explain the memory loss and thinking problems seen in early Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, drug treatments that aim to restore normal glutamate transmission may prove a beneficial therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.},

A subpopulation of GABAergic basket cells co-expresses the GABA/glycine vesicular transporters (VIAAT) and the atypical type III vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT3); therefore, these cells have the ability to signal with both GABA and glutamate. GABAergic transmission by basket cells has been extensively characterized but nothing is known about the functional implications of VGLUT3-dependent glutamate released by these cells. Here, using VGLUT3-null mice we observed that the loss of VGLUT3 results in a metaplastic shift in synaptic plasticity at Shaeffer's collaterals \textendash{} CA1 synapses and an altered theta oscillation. These changes were paralleled by the loss of a VGLUT3-dependent inhibition of GABAergic current in CA1 pyramidal layer. Therefore presynaptic type III metabotropic could be activated by glutamate released from VGLUT3-positive interneurons. This putative presynaptic heterologous feedback mechanism inhibits local GABAergic tone and regulates the hippocampal neuronal network.},

  abstract = {Previous work suggests that neostriatal cholinergic interneurons control the activity of several classes of GABAergic interneurons through fast nicotinic receptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Although indirect evidence has suggested the existence of several classes of interneurons controlled by this mechanism, only one such cell type, the neuropeptide-Y-expressing neurogliaform neuron, has been identified to date. Here we tested the hypothesis that in addition to the neurogliaform neurons that elicit slow GABAergic inhibitory responses, another interneuron type exists in the striatum that receives strong nicotinic cholinergic input and elicits conventional fast GABAergic synaptic responses in projection neurons. We obtained in vitro slice recordings from double transgenic mice in which Channelrhodopsin-2 was natively expressed in cholinergic neurons and a population of serotonin receptor-3a-Creexpressing GABAergic interneurons were visualized with tdTomato. We show that among the targeted GABAergic interneurons a novel type of interneuron, termed the fast-adapting interneuron, can be identified that is distinct from previously known interneurons based on immunocytochemical and electrophysiological criteria. We show using optogenetic activation of cholinergic inputs that fast-adapting interneurons receive a powerful supra-threshold nicotinic cholinergic input in vitro. Moreover, fast adapting neurons are densely connected to projection neurons and elicit fast, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current responses. The nicotinic receptor-mediated activation of fast-adapting interneurons may constitute an important mechanism through which cholinergic interneurons control the activity of projection neurons and perhaps the plasticity of their synaptic inputs when animals encounter reinforcing or otherwise salient stimuli.},

We report a broad physiological diversity between and within cell classes. We also found differences in the ability to produce postinhibitory rebound spikes and in the frequency and amplitude of incoming EPSPs. To understand the source of this intrinsic variability we applied hierarchical cluster analysis to functionally classify neurons. These analyses revealed physiologically derived cell types in EC that mostly corresponded to the lines identified by biomarkers with a few unexpected and important differences. Finally, we reduced the complex multidimensional space of intrinsic properties to the most salient five that predicted the cellular biomolecular identity with 81.4\% accuracy.

In this review we concentrate on presynaptic homeostatic plasticity controlling the efficacy of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic boutons. While morphological and electrophysiological approaches were successful to describe homeostatic plasticity-induced changes in the presynaptic architecture and function, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying those modifications remained largely unknown for a long time. We summarize the latest progress made in the understanding of homeostasis-induced regulation of different steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle and the molecular machineries involved in this process. We particularly focus on the role of presynaptic scaffolding proteins, which functionally and spatially organize synaptic vesicle clusters, neurotransmitter release sites and the associated endocytic machinery. These proteins turned out to be major presynaptic substrates for remodeling during homeostatic plasticity. Finally, we discuss cellular processes and signaling pathways acting during homeostatic molecular remodeling and their potential involvement in the maladaptive plasticity occurring in multiple neuropathologic conditions such as neurodegeneration, epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Synapsins are synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins organizing a component of the reserve pool of vesicles at most central nervous system synapses. Alternative splicing of the three mammalian genes results in multiple isoforms that may differentially contribute to the organization and maintenance of the SV pools. To address this, we first characterized the expression pattern of synapsin isoforms in the rat calyx of Held. At postnatal day 16, synapsins Ia, Ib, IIb and IIIa were present, while IIa\textemdash{}known to sustain repetitive transmission in glutamatergic terminals\textemdash{}was not detectable. To test if the synapsin I isoforms could mediate IIa-like effect, and if this depends on the presence of the E-domain, we overexpressed either synapsin Ia or synapsin Ib in the rat calyx of Held via recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer. Although the size and overall structure of the perturbed calyces remained unchanged, short-term depression and recovery from depression were accelerated upon overexpression of synapsin I isoforms. Using electron microscopic three-dimensional reconstructions we found a redistribution of SV clusters proximal to the active zones (AZ) alongside with a decrease of both AZ area and SV volume. The number of SVs at individual AZs was strongly reduced. Hence, our data indicate that the amount of synapsin Ia expressed in the calyx regulates the rate and extent of short-term synaptic plasticity by affecting vesicle recruitment to the AZ. Finally, our study reveals a novel contribution of synapsin Ia to define the surface area of AZs.},

  abstract = {The trigger for synaptic vesicle exocytosis is Ca2+, which enters the synaptic bouton following action potential stimulation. However, spontaneous release of neurotransmitter also occurs in the absence of stimulation in virtually all synaptic boutons. It has long been thought that this represents exocytosis driven by fluctuations in local Ca2+ levels. The vesicles responding to these fluctuations are thought to be the same ones that release upon stimulation, albeit potentially triggered by different Ca2+ sensors. This view has been challenged by several recent works, which have suggested that spontaneous release is driven by a separate pool of synaptic vesicles. Numerous articles appeared during the last few years in support of each of these hypotheses, and it has been challenging to bring them into accord. We speculate here on the origins of this controversy, and propose a solution that is related to developmental effects. Constitutive membrane traffic, needed for the biogenesis of vesicles and synapses, is responsible for high levels of spontaneous membrane fusion in young neurons, probably independent of Ca2+. The vesicles releasing spontaneously in such neurons are not related to other synaptic vesicle pools and may represent constitutively releasing vesicles (CRVs) rather than bona fide synaptic vesicles. In mature neurons, constitutive traffic is much dampened, and the few remaining spontaneous release events probably represent bona fide spontaneously releasing synaptic vesicles (SRSVs) responding to Ca2+ fluctuations, along with a handful of CRVs that participate in synaptic vesicle turnover.},

  abstract = {Here we summarize the evidence from two ``giant'' presynaptic terminals\textemdash{}the squid giant synapse and the mammalian calyx of Held\textemdash{}supporting the involvement of nanodomain calcium signals in triggering of neurotransmitter release. At the squid synapse, there are three main lines of experimental evidence for nanodomain signaling. First, changing the size of the unitary calcium channel current by altering external calcium concentration causes a non-linear change in transmitter release, while changing the number of open channels by broadening the presynaptic action potential causes a linear change in release. Second, low-affinity calcium indicators, calcium chelators, and uncaging of calcium all suggest that presynaptic calcium concentrations are as high as hundreds of micromolar, which is more compatible with a nanodomain type of calcium signal. Finally, neurotransmitter release is much less affected by the slow calcium chelator, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), in comparison to the rapid chelator 1,2-bis(oaminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Similarly, as the calyx of Held synapse matures, EGTA becomes less effective in attenuating transmitter release while the number of calcium channels required to trigger a single fusion event declines. This suggests a developmental transformation of microdomain to nanodomain coupling between calcium channels and transmitter release. Calcium imaging and uncaging experiments, in combination with simulations of calcium diffusion, indicate the peak calcium concentration seen by presynaptic calcium sensors reaches at least tens of micromolar at the calyx of Held. Taken together, data from these provide a compelling argument that nanodomain calcium signaling gates very rapid transmitter release.},

  abstract = {Central inter-neuronal synapses employ various molecular mechanisms to sustain neurotransmitter release during phases of high-frequency synaptic activity. One of the features ensuring this property is the presence of a pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the presynaptic terminal. At rest and low rates of stimulation, most of the vesicles composing this pool remain in a tight cluster. They are actively utilized when neurons fire action potentials at higher rates and the capability of the recycling machinery is limited. In addition, SV clusters are capable of migrating between release sites and reassemble into clusters at neighboring active zones (AZs). Within the cluster, thin ``tethers'' interconnect SVs.These dynamic filamentous structures are reorganized during stimulation thereby releasing SVs from the cluster. So far, one protein family, the synapsins, which bind actin filaments and vesicles in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, has been implicated in SV clustering in vertebrate synapses. As evident from recent studies, many endocytic proteins reside in the SV cluster in addition to synapsin. Here we discuss alternative possible mechanisms involved in the organization of this population of SVs. We propose a model in which synapsins together with other synaptic proteins, a large proportion of which is involved in SV recycling, form a dynamic proteinaceous ``matrix'' which limits the mobility of SVs. Actin filaments, however, do not seem to contribute to SV crosslinking within the SV cluster, but instead they are present peripherally to it, at sites of neurotransmitter release, and at sites of SV recycling.},

To test this hypothesis, we sought to directly activate subcortical cholinergic neurons during focal limbic seizures to determine the effects on cortical function. Here we used an optogenetic approach to selectively stimulate cholinergic brainstem neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus during focal limbic seizures induced in a lightly anesthetized rat model. We found an increase in cortical gamma activity and a decrease in delta activity in response to cholinergic stimulation. These findings support the mechanistic role of reduced subcortical cholinergic arousal in causing cortical dysfunction during seizures. Through further work, electrical or optogenetic stimulation of subcortical arousal networks may ultimately lead to new treatments aimed at preventing cortical dysfunction during seizures.},

  abstract = {Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism by which it causes cognitive decline is unclear. In knockin (KI) mice, human apoE4 causes age-dependent learning and memory impairments and degeneration of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Here we report two functional apoE4-KI phenotypes involving sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), hippocampal network events critical for memory processes. Aged apoE4-KI mice had fewer SWRs than apoE3-KI mice and significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs. Elimination of apoE4 in GABAergic interneurons, which prevents learning and memory impairments, rescued SWRassociated slow gamma activity but not SWR abundance in aged mice. SWR abundance was reduced similarly in young and aged apoE4-KI mice; however, the full SWR-associated slow gamma deficit emerged only in aged apoE4-KI mice. These results suggest that progressive decline of interneuronenabled slow gamma activity during SWRs critically contributes to apoE4-mediated learning and memory impairments.},

To mimic endogenous NEX expression in the dorsal telencephalon, the Cre recombinase gene was targeted into the NEX locus by homologous recombination in ES cells. The Cre expression pattern was analyzed following breeding into different lines of lacZindicator mice. Most prominent Cre activity was observed in neocortex and hippocampus, starting from around embryonic day 11.5. Within the dorsal telencephalon, Cre-mediated recombination marked pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus mossy and granule cells, but was absent from proliferating neural precursors of the ventricular zone, interneurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Additionally, we identified formerly unknown domains of NEX promoter activity in mid- and hindbrain. The NEX-Cre mouse will be a valuable tool for behavioral research and the conditional inactivation of target genes in pyramidal neurons of the dorsal telencephalon. genesis 44:611\textendash{}621, 2006.

To better understand the contributions of cholinergic and NMDA receptor activation to type I theta generation, we recorded hippocampal theta oscillations from freely moving mice with local infusion of cholinergic or NMDA receptor antagonists to either the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex (EC). We found that cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus, but not the EC, and NMDA receptors in the EC, but not the hippocampus, are critical for open-field theta generation and Y-maze performance. We further found that muscarinic M1 receptors located on pyramidal neurons, but not interneurons, are critical for cholinergic modulation of hippocampal synapses, theta generation, and Y-maze performance. These results suggest that hippocampus and EC neurons recruit cholinergicdependent and NMDA-receptor-dependent mechanisms, respectively, to generate theta oscillations to support behavioral performance.},

  volume = {10},
  issn = {1744-8069, 1744-8069},
  abstract = {Background: Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor have been shown to play an important role in the sensation of itch. However, although GRP immunoreactivity has been detected in the spinal dorsal horn, there is debate about whether this originates from primary afferents or local excitatory interneurons. We therefore examined the relation of GRP immunoreactivity to that seen with antibodies that label primary afferent or excitatory interneuron terminals. We tested the specificity of the GRP antibody by preincubating with peptides with which it could potentially cross-react. We also examined tissue from a mouse line in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under control of the GRP promoter.
Results: GRP immunoreactivity was seen in both primary afferent and non-primary glutamatergic axon terminals in the superficial dorsal horn. However, immunostaining was blocked by pre-incubation of the antibody with substance P, which is present at high levels in many nociceptive primary afferents. EGFP+ cells in the GRP-EGFP mouse did not express Pax2, and their axons contained the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), indicating that they are excitatory interneurons. In most cases, their axons were also GRP-immunoreactive. Multiple-labelling immunocytochemical studies indicated that these cells did not express either of the preprotachykinin peptides, and that they generally lacked protein kinase C{$\gamma$}, which is expressed by a subset of the excitatory interneurons in this region.
Conclusions: These results show that GRP is expressed by a distinct population of excitatory interneurons in laminae I-II that are likely to be involved in the itch pathway. They also suggest that the GRP immunoreactivity seen in primary afferents in previous studies may have resulted from cross-reaction of the GRP antibody with substance P or the closely related peptide neurokinin A.},

We show that sub-second measures of the individual synchronous response, namely\textemdash{}its latency and decay duration, are related to minutes-scale network response dynamics. Network responsiveness is reflected as residency in, or shifting amongst, areas of the latency-decay plane. The different sensitivities of latency and decay durations to synaptic blockers imply that these two measures reflect aspects of inhibitory and excitatory activities. Taken together, the data suggest that trial-to-trial variations in the synchronized responses of neural networks might be related to effective excitation-inhibition ratio being a dynamic variable over time scales of minutes.},

In the present study, mice matched for performance on commonly used anxiety tasks were trained on either the Barnes maze or water maze or received no cognitive testing. Water-maze training induced greater increases in plasma corticosterone than did Barnes maze training, assessed 30 min after the final session. Importantly, spatial learning was inversely correlated with corticosterone levels in the water maze but not the Barnes maze, suggesting that performance on the water maze may be more affected by test-induced stress even within wild-type subjects of the same age and gender. These findings are important when considering the appropriate cognitive tasks for any experiment in which stress responses may differ systematically across groups.},

However, all previous grid cell recordings used electrode techniques that provide limited descriptions of fine-scale organization. We therefore developed a technique for cellular-resolution functional imaging of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons in mice navigating a virtual linear track, enabling a new experimental approach to study MEC. Using these methods, we show that grid cells are physically clustered in MEC compared to nongrid cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that grid cells are functionally micro-organized: the similarity between the environment firing locations of grid cell pairs varies as a function of the distance between them according to a ``Mexican hat''-shaped profile. This suggests that, on average, nearby grid cells have more similar spatial firing phases than those further apart.},

In both hippocampus and neocortex, theta increased during virtual movement in all phases of the game. Hippocampal and neocortical theta activity were also significantly correlated with each other, but this correlation did not differ between neocortex and hippocampus and within disparate neocortical electrodes. Our findings demonstrate the existence of movement-related theta oscillations in human hippocampus, and suggest that both cortical and hippocampal oscillations play a role in attention and sensorimotor integration.

Medial EC (MEC) Layer II stellate cells (SCs) serve as one of the most prominent target cell types within the EC for inputs arising from higher cortical areas, and these same cells provide most of the output from the EC to the hippocampal region. We used the whole-cell patch clamp technique in a rat in vitro slice preparation to test whether SCs express afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents and if these currents can be modulated. Our results revealed that SCs contain medium (mIK(Ca)) and slow (sIAHP) Ca2+-dependent K+ currents. Furthermore, we determined that an apamin-sensitive current does not underlie the mAHP in SCs. Our studies also showed that a cAMP-dependent modulation process significantly reduces mIK(Ca), sIAHP, and spike-frequency adaptation in MEC Layer II SCs. Modulation of the firing pattern of SCs resulting from this effect may play an important role in the encoding of information related to memory processes. VC 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic oscillations within the 3\textendash{}12 Hz theta frequency band manifest in the rodent hippocampus during a variety of behaviors and are particularly well characterized during spatial navigation. In contrast, previous studies of rhythmic hippocampal activity in primates under comparable behavioral conditions suggest it may be less apparent and possibly less prevalent, or even absent, compared with the rodent. We compared the relative presence of low-frequency oscillations in rats and humans during spatial navigation by using an oscillation detection algorithm (``P-episode'' or ``BOSC'') to better characterize their presence in microelectrode local field potential (LFP) recordings. This method quantifies the proportion of time the LFP exceeds both a power and cycle duration threshold at each frequency, characterizing the presence of (1) oscillatory activity compared with background noise, (2) the peak frequency of oscillatory activity, and (3) the duration of oscillatory activity. Results demonstrate that both humans and rodents have hippocampal rhythmic fluctuations lasting, on average, 2.75 and 4.3 cycles, respectively. Analyses further suggest that human hippocampal rhythmicity is centered around \textasciitilde{}3 Hz while that of rats is centered around \textasciitilde{}8 Hz. These results establish that low-frequency rhythms relevant to spatial navigation are present in both the rodent and human hippocampus, albeit with different properties under the behavioral conditions tested.

In agreement with this hypothesis, we demonstrete here that it is pQssible to stimulate synapses that yield no detectable excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) when the cell is held at -60 mV; yet at positive holding potentials (+30 to +60 mV), EPSCs can be elicited that are completely blocked by the NMOAR antagonist, D-APV. When these functionally silent synapses are subjected to an LTP Induction protocol, EPSCs mediated by AMPARs appear and remain for the duration of the experiment. This conversion of silent synapses to functional synapses is blocked by D-APV. These results suggest that LTP may involve modification of AMPARs that, prior to LTP, were either not present in the postsynaptic membrane or electrophysiologically silent. This mechanism may account for several experimental results previously attributed to presynaptic changes in quantal content.},

This view is motivated by mounting evidence that the hippocampus is constantly constructing spatially coherent scenes, automatically anticipating and synthesizing representations of the world beyond the immediate sensorium. By characterizing the precise relationship between scenes and the hippocampus, we believe a theoretically enriched understanding of its fundamental role and its breakdown in pathology can emerge.},

  shorttitle = {Vesicle Dynamics},
  abstract = {Central synapses operate neurotransmission in several modes: synchronous/fast neurotransmission (neurotransmitters release is tightly coupled to action potentials and fast), asynchronous neurotransmission (neurotransmitter release is slower and longer lasting), and spontaneous neurotransmission (where small amounts of neurotransmitter are released without being evoked by an action potential). A substantial body of evidence from the past two decades suggests that seemingly identical synaptic vesicles possess distinct propensities to fuse, thus selectively serving different modes of neurotransmission. In efforts to better understand the mechanism(s) underlying the different modes of synaptic transmission, many research groups found that synaptic vesicles used in different modes of neurotransmission differ by a number of synaptic proteins. Synchronous transmission with higher temporal fidelity to stimulation seems to require synaptotagmin 1 and complexin for its Ca2+ sensitivity, RIM proteins for closer location of synaptic vesicles (SV) to the voltage operated calcium channels (VGCC), and dynamin for SV retrieval. Asynchronous release does not seem to require functional synaptotagmin 1 as a calcium sensor or complexins, but the activity of dynamin is indispensible for its maintenance. On the other hand, the control of spontaneous neurotransmission remains less clear as deleting a number of essential synaptic proteins does not abolish this type of synaptic vesicle fusion. VGCC distance from the SV seems to have little control on spontaneous transmission, while there is an involvement of functional synaptic proteins including synaptotagmins and complexin. Recently, presynaptic deficits have been proposed to contribute to a number of pathological conditions including cognitive and mental disorders. In this review, we evaluate recent advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of synaptic vesicle dynamics and in understanding how different molecular substrates maintain selective modes of neurotransmission. We also highlight the implications of these studies in understanding pathological conditions.},

@article{stehle_melatonin_2003,
  title = {Melatonin: {{A Clock}}-{{Output}}, {{A Clock}}-{{Input}}},
  abstract = {In mammals, the circadian system is comprised of three major components: the lateral eyes, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the pineal gland. The SCN harbours the endogenous oscillator that is entrained every day to the ambient lighting conditions via retinal input. Among the many circadian rhythms in the body that are driven by SCN output, the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland functions as a hormonal message encoding for the duration of darkness. Dissemination of this circadian information relies on the activation of melatonin receptors, which are most prominently expressed in the SCN, and the hypophyseal pars tuberalis (PT), but also in many other tissues. A deficiency in melatonin, or a lack in melatonin receptors should therefore have effects on circadian biology. However, our investigations of mice that are melatonin-proficient with mice that do not make melatonin, or alternatively cannot interpret the melatonin message, revealed that melatonin has only minor effects on signal transduction processes within the SCN and sets, at most, the gain for clock error signals mediated via the retino-hypothalamic tract. Melatonin deficiency has no effect on the rhythm generation, or on the maintenance of the oscillation. By contrast, melatonin is essential for rhythmic signalling in the PT. Here, melatonin acts in concert with adenosine to elicit rhythms in clock gene expression. By sensitizing adenylyl cyclase, melatonin opens a temporally-restricted gate and thus lowers the threshold for adenosine to induce cAMP-sensitive genes. This interaction, which determines a temporally precise regulation of gene expression, and by endocrine\textendash{}endocrine interactions possibly also pituitary output, may reflect a general mechanism by which the master clock in the brain synchronizes clock cells in peripheral tissues that require unique phasing of output signals.},

  abstract = {Ultradian pulsatile hormone secretion underlies the activity of most neuroendocrine systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) and gonadal (HPG) axes, and this pulsatile mode of signalling permits the encoding of information through both amplitude and frequency modulation. In the HPA axis, glucocorticoid pulse amplitude increases in anticipation of waking, and, in the HPG axis, changing gonadotrophin-releasing hormone pulse frequency is the primary means by which the body alters its reproductive status during development (i.e. puberty). The prevalence of hormone pulsatility raises two crucial questions: how are ultradian pulses encoded (or generated) by these systems, and how are these pulses decoded (or interpreted) at their target sites? We have looked at mechanisms within the HPA axis responsible for encoding the pulsatile mode of glucocorticoid signalling that we observe in vivo. We review evidence regarding the `hypothalamic pulse generator' hypothesis, and describe an alternative model for pulse generation, which involves steroid feedback-dependent endogenous rhythmic activity throughout the HPA axis. We consider the decoding of hormone pulsatility by taking the HPG axis as a model system and focussing on molecular mechanisms of frequency decoding by pituitary gonadotrophs.},

  shorttitle = {Sex {{Steroids}} and the {{Control}} of the {{Kiss1 System}}},
  abstract = {Kisspeptins, encoded by the Kiss1 gene, and their canonical receptor, GPR54 (also termed Kiss1R), are unanimously recognised as essential regulators of puberty onset and gonadotrophin secretion. These key reproductive functions stem from the capacity of kisspeptins to stimulate gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in the hypothalamus, where discrete populations of Kiss1 neurones have been identified. In rodents, two major groups of hypothalamic Kiss1 neurones exist: one present in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the other located in the anteroventral periventricular area (AVPV {$\fracslash$} RP3V). In recent years, numerous signals have been identified as putative modulators of the hypothalamic Kiss1 system. Among them, the prominent role of sex steroids as being important regulators of Kiss1 neurones has been documented in different species and developmental stages, such as early brain sex differentiation, puberty, adulthood and senescence. These regulatory actions are (mainly) conducted via oestrogen receptor (ER)a, which is expressed in almost all Kiss1 neurones, and likely involve both classical and nonclassical pathways. The regulatory effects of sex steroids are nucleus-specific. Thus, sex steroids inhibit the expression of Kiss1 {$\fracslash$} kisspeptin at the ARC, as a mechanism to conduct their negative-feedback actions on gonadotrophin secretion. By contrast, oestrogens enhance Kiss1 expression at the AVPV {$\fracslash$} RP3V in rodents, suggesting the involvement of this population in the positive-feedback actions of oestradiol to generate the preovulatory surge of gonadotrophins. In addition, sex steroids have been shown to act post-transcriptionally, modulating GnRH {$\fracslash$} gonadotrophin responsiveness to kisspeptin. Finally, sex steroids also regulate the expression of co-transmitters of Kiss1 neurones, such as neurokinin B, whose mRNA content in the ARC fluctuates in parallel to that of Kiss1 in response to changes in the circulating levels of sex steroids, therefore suggesting the contribution of this neuropeptide in the feedback control of gonadotrophin secretion. In sum, compelling experimental evidence obtained in different mammalian (and non-mammalian) species, including primates, demonstrates that sex steroids are essential regulators of hypothalamic Kiss1 neurones, which in turn operate as conduits for their effects on GnRH neurones. The physiological relevance of such regulatory phenomena is thoroughly discussed.},

As they receive direct input from olfactory receptor neurons and connect with mitral cells, they are involved in the initial stages of olfactory information processing, but little is known about their detailed physiological properties. Using whole cell patch-clamp techniques, we recorded from juxtaglomerular neurons in rat olfactory bulb slices. Based on their response to depolarizing pulses, juxtaglomerular neurons could be divided into two physiological classes: bursting and standard firing. When depolarized, the standard firing neurons exhibited a range of responses: accommodating, nonaccommodating, irregular firing, and delayed to firing patterns of action potentials. Although the firing pattern was not rigorously predictive of a particular neuronal morphology, most short axon cells fired accommodating trains of action potentials, while most delayed to firing cells were external tufted cells. In contrast to the standard firing neurons, bursting neurons produced a calcium-channel-dependent low-threshold spike when depolarized either by current injection or by spontaneous or evoked postsynaptic potentials. Bursting neurons also could oscillate spontaneously. Most bursting cells were either periglomerular cells or external tufted cells. Based on their mode of firing and placement in the bulb circuit, these bursting cells are well situated to drive synchronous oscillations in the olfactory bulb.},

  abstract = {Dendrodendritic synapses, distributed along mitral cell lateral dendrites, provide powerful and extensive inhibition in the olfactory bulb. Activation of inhibition depends on effective penetration of action potentials into dendrites. Although action potentials backpropagate with remarkable fidelity in apical dendrites, this issue is controversial for lateral dendrites. We used paired somatic and dendritic recordings to measure action potentials in proximal dendritic segments (0\textendash{}200 {$\mu$}m from soma) and action potential-generated calcium transients to monitor activity in distal dendritic segments (200\textendash{}600 {$\mu$}m from soma). Somatically elicited action potentials were attenuated in proximal lateral dendrites. The attenuation was not due to impaired access resistance in dendrites or to basal synaptic activity. However, a single somatically elicited action potential was sufficient to evoke a calcium transient throughout the lateral dendrite, suggesting that action potentials reach distal dendritic compartments. Block of A-type potassium channels ( I
              A
              ) with 4-aminopyridine (10 mM) prevented action potential attenuation in direct recordings and significantly increased dendritic calcium transients, particularly in distal dendritic compartments. Our results suggest that I

  abstract = {In the rodent main olfactory bulb (MOB), mitral cells (MCs) express high levels of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) subtype, mGluR1. The significance of this receptor in modulating MC excitability is unknown. We investigated the physiological role of mGluR1 in regulating MC activity in rat and mouse MOB slices. The selective group I agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), but not group II or III agonists, induced potent, dose-dependent, and reversible depolarization and increased firing of MCs. These effects persisted in the presence of blockers of fast synaptic transmission, indicating that they are due to direct activation of mGluRs on MCs. Voltage-clamp recordings showed that DHPG elicited a voltage-dependent inward current consisting of multiple components sensitive to potassium and calcium channel blockade and intracellular calcium chelation. MC excitatory responses to DHPG were absent in mGluR1 knockout mice but persisted in mGluR5 knockout mice. Broad-spectrum LY341495 , MCPG, as well as preferential mGluR1 LY367385 antagonists blocked the excitatory effects of DHPG and also potently modulated MC spontaneous and olfactory nerve-evoked excitability. mGluR antagonists altered spontaneous membrane potential bistability, increasing the duration of the up and down states. mGluR antagonists also substantially attenuated MC responses to sensory input, decreasing the probability and increasing the latency of olfactory nerve-evoked spikes. These findings suggest that endogenous glutamate tonically modulates MC excitability and responsiveness to olfactory nerve input, and hence the operation of the MOB circuitry, via activation of mGluR1.},

The membrane potential of the first-layer neurons, integrate-and-fire neurons corresponding to mitral cells, was modulated with a subthreshold oscillation at respiration frequency. The membrane potential of the second-layer neurons was used to discriminate input patterns. We implemented oscillating input with amplitudes and latencies different for each mitral cell. Not only varying the input amplitudes but also de-synchronizing the input, and varying the relation between latency and input amplitude, individually changed the model's performance significantly. The discrimination time was affected more easily than the number of second-layer neurons that can differentiate an odor pair. Increasing the de-synchronization, i.e., the spread of latency values, reduced the differences in response time between strong and weak stimulus pairs without reducing the number of reacting cells. Input phase relative to the subthreshold oscillation altered the effect of de-synchronization. Thus dynamic input changes performance parameters of models of olfactory information processing that can be verified experimentally.},

  abstract = {To understand the coding mechanisms underlying olfactory discrimination, it is necessary to characterize odor response properties of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In contrast with rapid progress in molecular biology, there is little physiological data from ORNs in rodent. To facilitate acquisition of such data, we have developed an intact olfactory epithelial preparation from both rat and mouse. We have carried out initial studies of this preparation by monitoring odor responses by patch-clamping directly on the ORN dendritic knobs, a subcellular site very close to the locus of olfactory signal transduction. Our results show that rat and mouse ORNs have similar intrinsic membrane properties. Most cells fired spontaneously at a low frequency ( f ) and about one half fired repetitively in response to current (I) injection with a linear f/I relation. About one third of rat and mouse ORNs responded to a mixture of four odors in a dose-dependent manner and about 60\% of them responded to IBMX, a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The results suggest that this intact preparation offers the advantage of approximating in vivo physiological conditions, while furnishing an opportunity to map single neuron responses in the epithelium in a spatially-defined manner, using electrophysiological or cell imaging methods. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Place and grid cells are thought to use a mixture of external sensory information and internal attractor dynamics to organize their activity. Attractor dynamics may explain both why neurons react coherently following sufficiently large changes to the environment (discrete attractors) and how firing patterns move smoothly from one representation to the next as an animal moves through space (continuous attractors). However, some features of place cell behavior, such as the sometimes independent responsiveness of place cells to environmental change (called ``remapping''), seem hard to reconcile with attractor dynamics. This paper suggests that the explanation may be found in an anatomical separation of the two attractor systems coupled with a dynamic contextual modulation of the connection matrix between the two systems, with new learning being back-propagated into the matrix. Such a scheme could explain how place cells sometimes behave coherently and sometimes independently.},

We made multiple (two to four) two-photon targeted whole-cell recordings from neighboring layer 2 mouse somatosensory barrel cortex pyramidal neurons in vivo to investigate excitatory monosynaptic transmission in the hyperpolarized downstate. We report that pyramidal neurons form a sparsely connected (6.7\% connectivity) network with an overrepresentation of bidirectional connections. The majority of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials were small in amplitude ({$<$}0.5 mV), with a small minority {$>$}1 mV. The coefficient of variation (CV = 0.74) could largely be explained by the presence of synaptic failures (22\%). Both the CV and failure rates were reduced with increasing amplitude. The mean paired-pulse ratio was 1.15 and positively correlated with the CV. Our approach will help bridge the gap between connectivity and function and allow investigations into the impact of brain state on monosynaptic transmission and integration.},

  abstract = {In mammals, circadian rhythms are generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. SCN neurons are heterogeneous and can be classified according to their function, anatomical connections, morphology and {$\fracslash$} or peptidergic identity. We focus here on gastrin-releasing peptide- (GRP) and on GRP receptor- (GRPr) expressing cells of the SCN. Pharmacological application of GRP in vivo or in vitro can shift the phase of circadian rhythms, and GRPr-deficient mice show blunted photic phase shifting. Given the in vivo and in vitro effects of GRP on circadian behavior and on SCN neuronal activity, we investigated whether the GRPr might be under circadian and {$\fracslash$} or diurnal control. Using in situ hybridization and autoradiographic receptor binding, we localized the GRPr in the mouse SCN and determined that GRP binding varies with time of day in animals housed in a light\textendash{}dark cycle but not in conditions of constant darkness. The latter results were confirmed with Western blots of SCN tissue. Together, the present findings reveal that changes in GRPr are light driven and not endogenously organized. Diurnal variation in GRPr activity probably underlies intra-SCN signaling important for entrainment and phase shifting.},

Therefore, identifying the network's topology has received a lot of attentions in neuroscience and has been the center of many research initiatives such as Human Connectome Project. Nevertheless, direct and invasive approaches that slice and observe the neural tissue have proven to be time consuming, complex and costly. As a result, the inverse methods that utilize firing activity of neurons in order to identify the (functional) connections have gained momentum recently, especially in light of rapid advances in recording technologies; It will soon be possible to simultaneously monitor the activities of tens of thousands of neurons in real time. While there are a number of excellent approaches that aim to identify the functional connections from firing activities, the scalability of the proposed techniques plays a major challenge in applying them on large-scale datasets of recorded firing activities. In exceptional cases where scalability has not been an issue, the theoretical performance guarantees are usually limited to a specific family of neurons or the type of firing activities. In this paper, we formulate the neural network reconstruction as an instance of a graph learning problem, where we observe the behavior of nodes/neurons (i.e., firing activities) and aim to find the links/connections. We develop a scalable learning mechanism and derive the conditions under which the estimated graph for a network of Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIf) neurons matches the true underlying synaptic connections. We then validate the performance of the algorithm using artificially generated data (for benchmarking) and real data recorded from multiple hippocampal areas in rats.},

  abstract = {Memory formation is associated with the generation of transiently stable neuronal assemblies. In hippocampal networks, such groups of functionally coupled neurons express highly ordered spatiotemporal activity patterns which are coordinated by local network oscillations. One of these patterns, sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-R), repetitively activates previously established groups of memory-encoding neurons, thereby supporting memory consolidation. This function implies that repetition of specific SPW-R induces plastic changes which render the underlying neuronal assemblies more stable. We modeled this repetitive activation in an in vitro model of SPW-R in mouse hippocampal slices. Weak electrical stimulation upstream of the CA3-CA1 networks reliably induced SPW-R of stereotypic waveform, thus representing re-activation of similar neuronal activity patterns. Frequent repetition of these patterns (100 times) reduced the variance of both, evoked and spontaneous SPW-R waveforms, indicating stabilization of pre-existing assemblies. These effects were most pronounced in the CA1 subfield and depended on the timing of stimulation relative to spontaneous SPW-R. Additionally, plasticity of SPW-R was blocked by application of a NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting a role for associative synaptic plasticity in this process. Thus, repetitive activation of specific patterns of SPW-R causes stabilization of memory-related networks.},

  abstract = {Using a continuous recognition memory procedure for spatial location information, rats were given sequential presentation of individual arms on a 12-arm maze. Each arm contained a Froot Loop reinforcement the first time it was presented, and latency to traverse the arm was measured. A subset of the arms were repeated, but did not contain reinforcement. Repeated arms were presented with lags ranging from zero to six (from zero to six different arm presentations occurred between the first and repeated presentation). After completion of acquisition training (significantly longer latencies for repeated arms in comparison with the first presentation of an arm), rats received lesions of the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, pre- and parasubiculum, or served as sham-operated controls. Based on continued postsurgery training and additional tests, the results indicated that rats with pre- and parasubiculum or pre- and parasubiculum plus medial entorhinal cortex produced sustained impairment in performing the task. Medial or lateral entorhinal cortex and control lesions did not display any sustained deficits. The data suggest that working memory for spatial location information is mediated primarily by the pre- and parasubiculum, but not medial entorhinal and lateral entorhinal cortex.

PV interneurons showed weak target-dependent delay-period activity and were strongly inhibited by reward. By contrast, SOM interneurons showed strong target-dependent delay-period activity, and only a subtype of them was inhibited by reward. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of PV and SOM interneurons preferentially suppressed discharges of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively.

  abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been well established between excitatory neurons and several computational functions have been proposed in various neural systems. Despite some recent efforts, however, there is a significant lack of functional understanding of inhibitory STDP (iSTDP) and its interplay with excitatory STDP (eSTDP). Here, we demonstrate by analytical and numerical methods that iSTDP contributes crucially to the balance of excitatory and inhibitory weights for the selection of a specific signaling pathway among other pathways in a feedforward circuit. This pathway selection is based on the high sensitivity of STDP to correlations in spike times, which complements a recent proposal for the role of iSTDP in firing-rate based selection. Our model predicts that asymmetric anti-Hebbian iSTDP exceeds asymmetric Hebbian iSTDP for supporting pathway-specific balance, which we show is useful for propagating transient neuronal responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate how STDPs at excitatory\textendash{}excitatory, excitatory\textendash{}inhibitory, and inhibitory\textendash{}excitatory synapses cooperate to improve the pathway selection. We propose that iSTDP is crucial for shaping the network structure that achieves efficient processing of synchronous spikes.},

  title = {Quantitative Firing Pattern Phenotyping of Hippocampal Neuron Types},
  abstract = {Abstract
          Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions. Hippocampome.org defines 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex) based on their somatic, axonal, and dendritic locations, putative excitatory/inhibitory outputs, molecular marker expression, and biophysical properties such as time constant and input resistance. Here we augment the electrophysiological data of this knowledge base by collecting, quantifying, and analyzing the firing responses to depolarizing current injections for every hippocampal neuron type from available published experiments. We designed and implemented objective protocols to classify firing patterns based on both transient and steady-state activity. Specifically, we identified 5 transients (delay, adapting spiking, rapidly adapting spiking, transient stuttering, and transient slow-wave bursting) and 4 steady states (non-adapting spiking, persistent stuttering, persistent slow-wave bursting, and silence). By characterizing the set of all firing responses reported for hippocampal neurons, this automated classification approach revealed 9 unique families of firing pattern phenotypes while distinguishing potential new neuronal subtypes. Several novel statistical associations also emerged between firing responses and other electrophysiological properties, morphological features, and molecular marker expression. The firing pattern parameters, complete experimental conditions (including solution and stimulus details), digitized spike times, exact reference to the original empirical evidence, and analysis scripts are released open-source through Hippocampome.org for all neuron types, greatly enhancing the existing search and browse capabilities. This information, collated online in human-and machine-accessible form, will help design and interpret both experiments and hippocampal model simulations.
          
            Significance Statement
            Comprehensive characterization of nerve cells is essential for understanding signal processing in biological neuronal networks. Firing patterns are important identification characteristics of neurons and play crucial roles in information coding in neural systems. Building upon the comprehensive knowledge base Hippocampome.org, we developed and implemented automated protocols to classify all known firing responses exhibited by each neuron type of the rodent hippocampus based on analysis of transient and steady-state activity. This approach identified the most distinguishing elements of every firing phenotype and revealed previously unnoticed statistical associations of firing responses with other electrophysiological, morphological, and molecular properties. The resulting data, freely released online, constitute a powerful resource for designing and interpreting experiments as well as developing and testing hippocampal models.},

We used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated shRNA expression to knock down Mover in the calyx of Held in vivo. Although spontaneous synaptic transmission remained unaffected, we found a strong increase of the evoked EPSC amplitude. The size of the readily releasable pool was unaltered, but short-term depression was accelerated and enhanced, consistent with an increase in release probability after Mover knockdown. This increase in release probability was not caused by alterations in Ca2+ influx but rather by a higher Ca2+ sensitivity of the release machinery, as demonstrated by presynaptic Ca2+ uncaging. We therefore conclude that Mover expression in certain subsets of synapses negatively regulates synaptic release probability, constituting a novel mechanism to tune synaptic transmission.},

  abstract = {Advanced statistical methods have enabled trial-by-trial inference of the underlying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (SCs) of membrane-potential recordings. Simultaneous inference of both excitatory and inhibitory SCs sheds light on the neural circuits underlying the neural activity and advances our understanding of neural information processing. Conventional Bayesian methods can infer excitatory and inhibitory SCs based on a single trial of observed membrane potential. However, if multiple recorded trials are available, this typically leads to suboptimal estimation because they neglect common statistics (of synaptic inputs (SIs)) across trials. Here, we establish a new expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that improves such single-trial Bayesian methods by exploiting multiple recorded trials to extract common SI statistics across the trials. In this paper, the proposed EM algorithm is embedded in parallel Kalman filters or particle filters for multiple recorded trials to integrate their outputs to iteratively update the common SI statistics. These statistics are then used to infer the excitatory and inhibitory SCs of individual trials. We demonstrate the superior performance of multiple-trial Kalman filtering (MtKF) and particle filtering (MtPF) relative to that of the corresponding single-trial methods. While relative estimation error of excitatory and inhibitory SCs is known to depend on the level of current injection into a cell, our numerical simulations using MtKF show that both excitatory and inhibitory SCs are reliably inferred using an optimal level of current injection. Finally, we validate the robustness and applicability of our technique through simulation studies, and we apply MtKF to in vivo data recorded from the rat barrel cortex.},

  abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBB) is crucial for hippocampal theta rhythm generation (4\textendash{}12 Hz). However, the mechanisms behind theta rhythmogenesis are still under debate. The MS/DBB consists, in its majority, of three neuronal populations that use acetylcholine, GABA, or glutamate as neurotransmitter. While the firing patterns of septal neurons enable the MS/DBB to generate rhythmic output critical for the generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, the ability to synchronize these action potentials is dependent on the interconnectivity between the three major MS/DBB neuronal populations, yet little is known about intraseptal connections. Here we assessed the connectivity between pairs of MS/DBB neurons with paired patch-clamp recordings. We found that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons provide intraseptal connections and produce sizable currents in MS/DBB postsynaptic cells. We also analyzed linear and nonlinear relationships between the action potentials fired by pairs of neurons belonging to various MS/DBB neuronal populations. Our results show that while the synchrony index for action potential firing was significantly higher in pairs of GABAergic neurons, coherence of action potential firing in the theta range was similarly low in all pairs analyzed. Recurrence analysis demonstrated that individual action potentials were more recurrent in cholinergic neurons than in other cell types. Implementing sparse connectivity in a computer model of the MS/DBB network reproduced our experimental data. We conclude that the interplay between the intrinsic membrane properties of different MS/DBB neuronal populations and the connectivity among these populations underlie the ability of the MS/DBB network to critically contribute to hippocampal theta rhythmogenesis.},

  abstract = {Dendritic spines are the receptive contacts at most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. Spines are dynamic in the developing brain, changing shape as they mature as well as appearing and disappearing as they make and break connections. Spines become much more stable in adulthood, and spine structure must be actively maintained to support established circuit function. At the same time, adult spines must retain some plasticity so their structure can be modified by activity and experience. As such, the regulation of spine stability and remodeling in the adult animal is critical for normal function, and disruption of these processes is associated with a variety of late onset diseases including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM), composed of a meshwork of proteins and proteoglycans, is a critical regulator of spine and synapse stability and plasticity. While the role of ECM receptors in spine regulation has been extensively studied, considerably less research has focused directly on the role of specific ECM ligands. Here, we review the evidence for a role of several brain ECM ligands and remodeling proteases in the regulation of dendritic spine and synapse formation, plasticity, and stability in adults.},

However, it remains unclear what determines AP initiation in different interneurons.

Patchclamp recording from mouse prefrontal cortical slices showed that axonal but not somatic Na+ channels exhibit different voltage-dependent properties. The minimal activation voltage of axonal channels in SST was substantially higher (,7 mV) than in PV cells, consistent with differences in AP thresholds. A more mixed distribution of high- and low-threshold channel subtypes at the axon initial segment (AIS) of SST cells may lead to these differences. Surprisingly, NaV1.2 was found accumulated at AIS of SST but not PV cells; reducing NaV1.2-mediated currents in interneurons promoted recurrent network activity. Together, our results reveal the molecular identity of axonal Na+ channels in interneurons and their contribution to AP generation and regulation of network activity.},

  abstract = {Whereas activation of a1-adrenoceptors (a1-ARs) modulates glutamatergic transmission, the roles of a1-ARs in GABAergic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are elusive. Here, we examined the effects of the a1-AR agonist phenylephrine (Phe) on GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of the mPFC. We found that bath application of Phe dose-dependently increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). Phe increased the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Ca2+ influx through T-type voltage-gated calcium channels is required for Phe-induced increases in GABA release. Phe increases GABA release probability and the number of releasable vesicles. Phe depolarizes the fast-spiking (FS) interneurons without effects on the firing rate of action potentials (APs) of interneurons. Pheinduced depolarization is independent of extracellular Na+, Ca2+ and T-type calcium channels, but requires inward rectifier K+ channels (Kirs). The present study demonstrates that Phe enhances GABAergic transmission onto mPFC pyramidal neurons through inhibiting interneurons Kirs, which further depolarizes interneurons leading to increase in Ca2+ influx via T-type calcium channels. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that helps explain a1-AR-induced PFC dysfunction. {\'O} 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nevertheless, how KARs cluster and function at these synapses has been unclear. Here, we show that C1q-like proteins C1ql2 and C1ql3, produced by MFs, serve as extracellular organizers to recruit functional postsynaptic KAR complexes to the CA3 pyramidal neurons. C1ql2 and C1ql3 specifically bound the amino-terminal domains of postsynaptic GluK2 and GluK4 KAR subunits and the presynaptic neurexin 3 containing a specific sequence in vitro. In C1ql2/3 double-null mice, CA3 synaptic responses lost the slow, KAR-mediated components. Furthermore, despite induction of MF sprouting in a temporal lobe epilepsy model, KARs were not recruited to postsynaptic sites in C1ql2/3 double-null mice, leading to reduced recurrent circuit activities. C1q family proteins, broadly expressed, are likely to modulate KAR function throughout the brain and represent promising antiepileptic targets.},

  abstract = {Memory retrieval requires coordinated intra- and inter-regional activity in networks of brain structures. Dysfunction of these networks and memory impairment are seen in many psychiatric disorders, but relatively little is known about how memory retrieval and memory failure are represented at the level of local and regional oscillatory activity. To address this question, we measured local field potentials (LFPs) from mice as they explored a novel context, retrieved memories for contextual fear conditioning, and after administration of two amnestic agents: the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine (SCOP). LFPs were simultaneously recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which are involved in processing contextual memories, and analyzed for changes in intra-regional power and inter-regional peak coherence of oscillations across multiple frequency bands. Context encoding and memory retrieval sessions yielded similar patterns of changes across all three structures, including decreased delta power and increased theta peak coherence. Baseline effects of MK-801 and SCOP were primarily targeted to gamma oscillations, but in opposite directions. Both drugs also blocked memory retrieval, as indicated by reduced freezing when mice were returned to the conditioning context, but this common behavioral impairment was only associated with power and peak coherence disruptions after MK-801 treatment. These findings point to neural signatures for memory impairment, whose underlying mechanisms may serve as therapeutic targets for related psychiatric disorders.},

A complex cytomatrix of proteins exclusively assembled at active zones, the CAZ, is thought to form a molecular scaffold that organizes neurotransmitter release sites. Here, we have analyzed synaptic targeting and cytomatrix association of Bassoon, a major scaffolding protein of the CAZ. By combining immunocytochemistry and transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons, we show that the central portion of Bassoon is crucially involved in synaptic targeting and CAZ association. An N-terminal region harbors a distinct capacity for N-myristoylation-dependent targeting to synaptic vesicle clusters, but is not incorporated into the CAZ. Our data provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of distinct functional regions in Bassoon and suggest that a centrally located CAZ targeting function may be complemented by an N-terminal capacity for targeting to membrane-bounded synaptic organelles.},

In contrast, the Flop versions are expressed at low levels prior to postnatal day 8.

  title = {Neuron Numbers in the Presubiculum, Parasubiculum, and Entorhinal Area of the Rat},
  abstract = {Estimates of neuron numbers have been useful in studies of neurodegenerative disorders, and in their animal models, and in the computational modeling of hippocampal function. Although the retrohippocampal region (presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal area) is an integral part of the hippocampal circuitry and is affected selectively in a number of disorders, estimates of neuron numbers in the rat retrohippocampal region have yet to be published. Such data are necessary ingredients for computational models of the function of this region and will also facilitate a comparison of this region in rats and primates, which will help to determine how well we may expect rat models to predict function and dysfunction in primate brains. In the present study, we used the optical fractionator to estimate the number of neurons in the rat retrohippocampal region. The following estimates were obtained: 3.3 3 105 in presubicular layers II and III, 1.5 3 105 in parasubicular layers II and III, 2.2 3 105 in the combined pre- and parasubicular layers V and VI, 6.6 3 104 in medial entorhinal area (MEA) layer II, 1.3 3 105 in MEA layer III, 1.9 3 105 in MEA layers V and VI, 4.6 3 104 in lateral entorhinal area (LEA) layer II, 1.2 3 105 in LEA layer III, and 1.4 3 105 in LEA layers V and VI. A surprising finding was the large numbers of neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum, which indicate an important role of these areas in the control of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. A comparison of the numbers of neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal areas in rats with similar estimates in humans revealed that gross input-output relations are largely conserved. Differences between rats and humans may be accounted for by more prominent entorhino-neocortical projections in primates and consequent increases in the number of neurons in the hippocampus and retrohippocampal region, which are dedicated to these projections.

These vesicles reside in different `pools', which have been given a bewildering array of names. In this review, we focus on five tissue preparations in which synaptic vesicle pools have been identified and thoroughly characterized. We argue that, in each preparation, each vesicle can be assigned to one of three distinct pools.},

However, synaptic terminals also release neurotransmitters by spontaneous vesicle fusion, which is independent of presynaptic action potentials. A functional role for spontaneous neurotransmitter release events in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, as well as the regulation of certain behaviours, has been reported. In addition, there is evidence that the presynaptic mechanisms underlying spontaneous release of neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic targets are segregated from those of evoked neurotransmission. These findings challenge current assumptions about neuronal signalling and neurotransmission, as they indicate that spontaneous neurotransmission has an autonomous role in interneuronal communication that is distinct from that of evoked release.},

Considerable progress has been made in defining the functional roles of the various channels and in identifying the {$\alpha$}-subunits encoding these channels. Much less is known, however, about the functioning of channel accessory subunits and/or posttranslational processing of the channel proteins. It has also become clear that cardiac ion channels function as components of macromolecular complexes, comprising the {$\alpha$}-subunits, one or more accessory subunit, and a variety of other regulatory proteins. In addition, these macromolecular channel protein complexes appear to interact with the actin cytoskeleton and/or the extracellular matrix, suggesting important functional links between channel complexes, as well as between cardiac structure and electrical functioning. Important areas of future research will be the identification of (all of) the molecular components of functional cardiac ion channels and delineation of the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the expression and the functioning of these channels in the normal and the diseased myocardium.},

These proteins share regions of high sequence similarity and have very high molecular weights ({$>$}400 kDa). Since Piccolo knockout mice have not yet been established, the role of Piccolo in the neuronal system remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Piccolo antisense oligonucleotide injected into the ventricle on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning and memory assessed with the novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze test. There was no significant difference in cognitive memory between Piccolo antisense-treated and vehicle- or sense-treated mice; however, spatial learning in Piccolo antisense-treated mice was impaired but not in sense- or vehicle-treated mice. Next, we investigated LTP formation in these groups in area CA1 and dentate gyrus of the same hippocampal slices. The magnitude of LTP in Piccolo antisense-treated mice was significantly lower than in sense- or vehicle-treated mice, with no change in basal level. Moreover, the level of high K+-induced glutamate release in the antisense-treated mice was significantly lower than in sense-treated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Piccolo plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity in area CA1 and in hippocampus-dependent learning in mice, and that the extracellular levels of glutamate in the hippocampus under stimulated conditions are controlled by Piccolo.},

  issn = {1423-0194, 0028-3835},
  abstract = {In this review, we provide an overview of recent literature on glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity in mood disorders. Assessing GC sensitivity is often performed by measuring the cortisol awakening rise (CAR), by challenging the hypothalamic-pituitary\textendash{}adrenal (HPA) axis using a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) or a dexamethasone/cortisol-releasing hormone test (DEX/CRH); more recently by measuring cortisol as a retrospective calendar in scalp hair. The main findings in mood disorders are higher mean cortisol levels in hair samples and a higher CAR, showing a hyperactivity of the HPA axis. This is in line with the mild resistance for GCs previously observed in challenge tests during mood episodes. GC sensitivity is partly determined by polymorphisms in the genes encoding receptors and other proteins involved in the regulation of the HPA axis. We shortly discuss the glucocorticoid receptor, as well as the mineralocorticoid receptor, the cortisol-releasing hormone receptor-1, and the glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone FKBP5. Data clearly indicate genetic changes, along with epigenetic changes which influence the set-point and regulation of the HPA axis. Early trauma, as well as influences in utero, appears to be important. Future research is necessary to further clarify the biological background and consequences of an individual's cortisol exposure in relation to mood.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that the `epidemic' increase of childhood allergy may be associated with environmental factors such as stress. Although the impact of stress on the manifestation and exacerbation of allergy has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms of stressinduced exacerbation are still obscure. A growing number of studies have suggested an altered hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis function to stress in allergic children. It is speculated that a dysfunctional HPA axis in response to stress may facilitate and/or consolidate immunological aberrations and thus, may increase the risk for allergic sensitization and exacerbation especially under stressful conditions. In the present review the potential impact of a hyporesponsive as well as a hyperresponsive HPA axis on the onset and chronification of childhood allergy is summarized. Moreover, potential factors that may contribute to the development of an aberrant HPA axis responsiveness in allergy are discussed.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity to GABA of Purkinje cells in thin cerebellar slices was examined by recording either spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents or ionic currents elicited by local GABA applications. The effects of Ca*+entry induced by depolarizing voltage pulses were opposite for the two types of currents. Currents due to exogenous CABA applications were increased by a train of voltage pulses. This potentiation was transient with an average half recovery period of 3.7 min. Spontaneous synaptic currents were reduced by depolarizing voltage pulses, with a half recovery time of about 20 s. The inhibition was largely explained by a decrease of the frequency of synaptic events, suggesting that the primary location of the effect was presynaptic. Thus, a Ca*+ rise increases the sensitivity of Purkinje cells to CABA and induces a retrograde inhibition of presynaptic terminals. The latter effect may be due to a diffusible Ca*+-dependent messenger.},

We also examined depletion at individual synapses using high frequency stimulation, and estimated the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool, which averaged 5.0 Ϯ 3.0 quanta (n ϭ 13 synapses). In addition, these experiments demonstrate that the release probability at a synapse is directly correlated with the size of its readily releasable vesicle pool.},

Vesicle pool size, exocytotic efficiency (amount of exocytosis per Ca influx), Ca current facilitation, and the number of active zones (AZs) increased with age, whereas AZ area, number of docked vesicles per AZ, and release probability decreased with age. These changes led to AZs that are less prone to multivesicular release, resulting in reduced AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization.

The excitatory Cl- current amplifies the small CNG current and crucially depends on a high intracellular Cl- concentration. We show here that a Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter, NKCC1, is required for this Cl- current, in that ORNs deficient in Nkcc1 or incubated with an NKCC blocker (bumetanide) lack the Cl- current. Surprisingly, immunocytochemistry indicates that NKCC1 is located on the somata and dendrites of ORNs rather than the cilia, where transduction occurs. This topography is remarkably similar to the situation in secretory epithelial cells, where basolateral Cl- uptake and apical Cl- efflux facilitate transepithelial fluid movement. Thus, a single functional architecture serves two entirely different purposes, probably underscoring the epithelial origin of the ORNs.},

Patterned electrical stimulation of afferents that mimicked a natural odor stimulus elicited rapidly synchronized spikes (lag \% 5 ms) in mitral cells, along with oscillatory activity at the gamma (w50 Hz) frequency. Analysis of coupling potentials, combined with dendritic sectioning, indicated that mitral cell synchrony was mainly driven by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) imposed by GABAergic granule cells. Recordings in granule cell pairs indicated that granule cells were themselves synchronized by their excitatory inputs from mitral cells, providing a means to coordinate GABA release. These results demonstrate that rapid synchrony can emerge in a network through the precise back-and-forth interplay between neuronal populations.},

While dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells are typically thought to be a major source of this modulation, the contributions of other inhibitory neurons remain unclear. Here we demonstrate the functional properties of olfactory bulb parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV cells) and identify their important role in odor coding. Using paired recordings, we find that PV cells form reciprocal connections with the majority of nearby mitral cells, in contrast to the sparse connectivity between mitral and granule cells. In vivo calcium imaging in awake mice reveals that PV cells are broadly tuned to odors. Furthermore, selective PV cell inactivation enhances mitral cell responses in a linear fashion while maintaining mitral cell odor preferences. Thus, dense connections between mitral and PV cells underlie an inhibitory circuit poised to modulate the gain of olfactory bulb output.},

  abstract = {In the mouse olfactory bulb, information from sensory neurons is extensively processed by local interneurons before being transmitted to the olfactory cortex by mitral and tufted (M/T) cells. The precise function of these local networks remains elusive because of the vast heterogeneity of interneurons, their diverse physiological properties, and their complex synaptic connectivity. Here we identified the parvalbumin interneurons (PVNs) as a prominent component of the M/T presynaptic landscape by using an improved rabies-based transsynaptic tracing method for local circuits. In vivo two-photon-targeted patch recording revealed that PVNs have exceptionally broad olfactory receptive fields and exhibit largely excitatory and persistent odor responses. Transsynaptic tracing indicated that PVNs receive direct input from widely distributed M/T cells. Both the anatomical and functional extent of this M/T/ PVN/M/T circuit contrasts with the narrowly confined M/T/granule cell/M/T circuit, suggesting that olfactory information is processed by multiple local circuits operating at distinct spatial scales.},

These events can represent spatial trajectories extending from the animal's current location to distant locations, suggesting a role in the evaluation of upcoming choices. While SWRs have been linked to learning and memory, the specific role of awake replay remains unclear. Here we show that there is greater coordinated neural activity during SWRs preceding correct, as compared to incorrect, trials in a spatial alternation task. As a result, the proportion of cell pairs coactive during SWRs was predictive of subsequent correct or incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect was seen specifically during early learning, when the hippocampus is essential for task performance. SWR activity preceding correct trials represented multiple trajectories that included both correct and incorrect options. These results suggest that reactivation during awake SWRs contributes to the evaluation of possible choices during memory-guided decision making.},

Although many SNARE proteins are available per vesicle, only one to three SNARE complexes are minimally needed for a fusion reaction. Here, we use high-resolution measurements of synaptic transmission in the calyx-of-Held synapse from mutant mice in which syntaxin-1 is rendered constitutively open and SNARE-complex assembly is enhanced to examine the relation between SNARE-complex assembly and neurotransmitter release. We show that enhancing SNARE-complex assembly dramatically increases the speed of evoked release, potentiates the Ca2+-affinity of release, and accelerates fusion-pore expansion during individual vesicle fusion events. Our data indicate that the number of assembled SNARE complexes per vesicle during fusion determines the presynaptic release probability and fusion kinetics and suggest a mechanism whereby proteins (Munc13 or RIM) may control presynaptic plasticity by regulating SNARE-complex assembly.},

Selective knockdown of CNIH2 markedly accelerated EPSCs in individual MFB-mossy cell synapses without altering the EPSC amplitude. In contrast, the rapidly decaying EPSCs in synapses between MFBs and aspiny interneurons that lack expression of CNIH2 were unaffected by the protein knockdown but were slowed by virus-directed expression of CNIH2. These results identify CNIH2 as the molecular distinction between slow and fast EPSC phenotypes and show that CNIH2 influences the time course and, hence, the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission.},

In the auditory system, rhythmic bursts of spontaneous activity are generated in cochlear hair cells and propagated along central auditory pathways. The role of these activity patterns in the development of central auditory circuits has remained speculative. Here we demonstrate that blocking efferent cholinergic neurotransmission to developing hair cells in mice that lack the a9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (a9 KO mice) altered the temporal fine structure of spontaneous activity without changing activity levels. KO mice showed a severe impairment in the functional and structural sharpening of an inhibitory tonotopic map, as evidenced by deficits in synaptic strengthening and silencing of connections and an absence in axonal pruning. These results provide evidence that the precise temporal pattern of spontaneous activity before hearing onset is crucial for the establishment of precise tonotopy, the major organizing principle of central auditory pathways.},

Their relative contribution to synaptic transmission changes during development and tunes neurotransmission during synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of differential recruitment of CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 to release sites is largely unknown. Here, we show that the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon localizes specifically CaV2.1 to active zones via molecular interaction with the RIM-binding proteins (RBPs). A genetic deletion of Bassoon or an acute interference with Bassoon-RBP interaction reduces synaptic abundance of CaV2.1, weakens P/Q-type Ca2+ current-driven synaptic transmission, and results in higher relative contribution of neurotransmission dependent on CaV2.2. These data establish Bassoon as a major regulator of the molecular composition of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites.},

Na+ flux through presynaptic plasma membrane hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels enhanced presynaptic Na+ concentration and thus controlled postsynaptic quantal size.

To investigate this, we combined freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling of Cav2.1 channels, local [Ca2+] imaging, and patch pipette perfusion of EGTA at the calyx of Held. Between postnatal day 7 and 21, VGCCs formed variable sized clusters and vesicular release became less sensitive to EGTA, whereas fixed Ca2+ buffer properties remained constant. Experimentally constrained reaction-diffusion simulations suggest that Ca2+ sensors for vesicular release are located at the perimeter of VGCC clusters ({$<$}30 nm) and predict that VGCC number per cluster determines vesicular release probability without altering release time course. This ``perimeter release model'' provides a unifying framework accounting for developmental changes in both synaptic efficacy and time course.},

For this purpose, various methods have been applied to the calyx of Held synapse. The results confirm many aspects of the early findings on transmission at the neuromuscular junction. On the other hand, the simplest quantal hypothesis does not work at the calyx of Held, because of additional factors such as heterogeneous release probability of synaptic vesicles, intra- and intersite quantal variability, an overlap of facilitation and depression of transmitter release, changes in quantal sizes due to desensitization and saturation of postsynaptic receptors, and delayed clearance of transmitter from the synaptic cleft. These factors should always be taken into account for fully understanding the mechanisms of synaptic transmission and plasticity.},

Electrical stimulation of the lateral entorhinal cortex revealed a strong excitation by both N-methyl--aspartate and non-N-methyl--aspartate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Type 2 cells accommodated strongly, had lower input resistances, faster time constants and featured prominent synaptic inhibition. Type 1 and 2 cells responded to repetitive synaptic stimulation with a prolonged hyperpolarization. We identified the two other, presumed local circuit, cell types whose axons remained within the entorhinal cortex. Type 3 cells were regular firing, had high input resistances and slow membrane time constants, while type 4 cells fired at higher frequencies and possessed a faster time constant and lower input resistance than type 3 neurons. Type 3 cells presented long-lasting excitatory synaptic potentials. Type 4 neurons were the only ones with different responses to stimulation from different sites. Upon lateral entorhinal cortex stimulation they responded with an excitatory postsynaptic potential, while a monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potential was evoked from deep layer stimulation. In contrast to type 1 and 2 neurons, none of the local circuit cells could be antidromically activated from deep layers, and prolonged hyperpolarizations following synaptic repetitive stimulation were also absent in these cells.},

Three parallel zones in presynaptic terminals were sampled: zones I and II, each about one synaptic vesicle wide extending from the active zone; and zone III, containing a distal pool of vesicles up to 200 nm from the presynaptic membrane. The distributions of SV2 and synaptophysin, two synaptic vesicle integral membrane proteins, generally followed the distribution of synaptic vesicles, which were typically evenly distributed under control conditions and had a notable depletion in zone III after stimulation. Labels of synapsin I and synuclein, two synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, were similar to each other; both were particularly sparse in zone I under control conditions but showed a prominent enrichment toward the active zone, after stimulation. Labels of Bassoon, Piccolo and RIM 1, three active zone proteins, had very different distribution profiles from one another under control conditions. Bassoon was enriched in zone II, Piccolo and RIM 1 in zone I. After stimulation, Bassoon and Piccolo remained relatively unchanged, but RIM 1 redistributed with a significant decrease in zone I, and increases in zones II and III. These results demonstrate that Bassoon and Piccolo are stable components of the active zone while RIM 1, synapsin I and synuclein undergo dynamic redistribution with synaptic activity.

  abstract = {In traditional studies of changes in cell membrane potential or trans-membrane currents a large part of the recorded data presents ``a pure noise.'' This noise results mainly from the random openings of membrane ionic channels. Different types of stationary or non-stationary noise analysis have been used in electrophysiological experiments for identification of channels kinetic states. But these methods have a limited power and often cannot answer to the main question of the experimental study: do external factors induce a significant change of channels kinetics? A new method suggested in the current study is based on the scaling properties of the beta-distribution function that allows reducing the series containing 200,000 and more data points to analysis of only 10\textendash{}20 stable parameters. The following clusterization using the generalized Pearson correlation function allows taking into account the influence of an external factor and combine/separate different parameters of interest into a statistical cluster considering the influential parameter. This method which we call BRC (Beta distribution-Reduction-Clusterization) opens new possibilities in creation of a largely reduced database while extracting specific fingerprints of the long-term series. The BRC method was validated using patch clamp current recordings containing 250,000 data points obtained from the living cells and from open tip electrode. The numerical distinction between these two series in terms of the reduced parameters was obtained.},

  abstract = {Similarities and differences in the visual content, scale, and shape of environmental boundaries for two environments have been extensively examined for their impact on the recurrence of spatially specific hippocampal firing patterns across environments and across multiple regions of a single environment. Although the shapes of paths taken through an environment are known to impact hippocampal firing patterns within any single region of a single environment, it is not known to what extent path shape and scale can impact firing pattern recurrence across two environments and across multiple regions of a single environment. This question was addressed in the present work where the spatial firing patterns of hippocampal CA1 neurons were examined as rats traversed differently shaped spiral paths centered on the same position within a visually observable curtained enclosure. On such tracks, firing fields for CA1 neurons were found to recur across multiple subregions of a single path and across similarly positioned regions of different paths. Both within and across different spiral tracks, the extent of such pattern recurrence was strongly influenced by similarity in the specific sequences of movement directions and locomotor behaviors engendered by different path shapes. The findings demonstrate that the shapes of paths taken through an environment can robustly and dynamically alter both the scale of spatially specific CA1 firing fields and the extent to which they recur across environments.},

  abstract = {The unipolar brush cell (UBC) is a type of glutamatergic interneuron in the granular layer of the cerebellum. The UBC brush and a single mossy fiber (MF) terminal contact each other within a cerebellar glomerulus, forming a giant synapse. Many UBCs receive input from extrinsic MFs, whereas others are innervated by intrinsic mossy terminals formed by the axons of other UBCs. In all mammalian species so far examined, the vestibulocerebellum is enriched of UBCs that are strongly immunoreactive for the calcium binding protein calretinin (CR) in both the somatodendritic and axonal compartment. UBCs have postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors and extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors that immunocytochemically highlight their somatodendritic compartment and brush, respectively. In this study on the mouse cerebellum, we present evidence that immunoreactivities to CR and mGluR1\textvisiblespace{} define two distinct UBC subsets with partly overlapping distributions in lobule X (the nodulus). In sections double-labeled for CR and mGluR1\textvisiblespace, the patterns of distributions of CRϩ/mGluR1\textvisiblespace{}Ϫ UBCs and CRϪ/mGluR1\textvisiblespace{}ϩ UBCs differed along the mediolateral and dorsoventral axes of the folium. Moreover, mGluR1\textvisiblespace{}ϩ UBCs outnumbered CRϩ UBCs. Both UBC subsets were mGluR2/3, GluR2/3, and NMDAR1 immunoreactive. The different distribution patterns of the two UBC subsets within lobule X suggest that expression of CR or mGluR1\textvisiblespace{} by UBCs may be afferent-specific and related to the terminal fields of different vestibular MF afferents.

Based on a widely used STP model, we develop an analytical characterization of the STP parameter space to determine the nature of each synapse (facilitating, depressing, or both) in a spiking neural network based on presynaptic firing rate and the corresponding STP parameters. We demonstrate consistency with previous work by leveraging the power of our characterization to replicate the functional volumes that are integral for the previous network stabilization results. We then use our characterization to predict the precise transitional point from the facilitating regime to the depressing regime in a simulated synapse, suggesting in vitro experiments to verify the underlying STP model. We conclude the work by integrating our characterization into a framework for finding suitable STP parameters for self-sustaining random, asynchronous activity in a prescribed recurrent spiking neural network. The systematic process resulting from our analytical characterization improves the success rate of finding the requisite parameters for such networks by three orders of magnitude over a random search.},

The ion channels' state transitions are stochastic and introduce fluctuations in the macroscopic current through ion channel populations. This creates an unavoidable source of intrinsic electrical noise for the neuron, leading to fluctuations in the membrane potential and spontaneous spikes. While this effect is well known, the impact of channel noise on single neuron dynamics remains poorly understood. Most results are based on numerical simulations. There is no agreement, even in theoretical studies, on which ion channel type is the dominant noise source, nor how inclusion of additional ion channel types affects voltage noise. Here we describe a framework to calculate voltage noise directly from an arbitrary set of ion channel models, and discuss how this can be use to estimate spontaneous spike rates.},

  abstract = {Some neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) fire bursts when the animal occupies locations organized in a hexagonal grid pattern in their spatial environment. Place cells have also been observed, firing bursts only when the animal occupies a particular region of the environment. Both of these types of cells exhibit theta-cycle modulation, firing bursts in the 4\textendash{}12 Hz range. Grid cells fire bursts of action potentials that precess with respect to the theta cycle, a phenomenon dubbed ``theta precession.'' Various models have been proposed to explain these phenomena, and how they relate to navigation. Among the most promising are the oscillator interference models. The bank-of-oscillators model proposed by Welday et al. (2011) exhibits all these features. However, their simulations are based on theoretical oscillators, and not implemented entirely with spiking neurons. We extend their work in a number of ways. First, we place the oscillators in a frequency domain and reformulate the model in terms of Fourier theory. Second, this perspective suggests a division of labor for implementing spatial maps: position vs. map layout. The animal's position is encoded in the phases of the oscillators, while the spatial map shape is encoded implicitly in the weights of the connections between the oscillators and the read-out nodes. Third, it reveals that the oscillator phases all need to conform to a linear relationship across the frequency domain. Fourth, we implement a partial model of the EC using spiking leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Fifth, we devise new coupling mechanisms, enlightened by the global phase constraint, and show they are capable of keeping spiking neural oscillators in consistent formation. Our model demonstrates place cells, grid cells, and phase precession. The Fourier model also gives direction for future investigations, such as integrating sensory feedback to combat drift, or explaining why grid cells exist at all.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Elucidating specializations of the intrinsic neuronal network between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus is a recently emerging area of research that is expected to help us understand the mechanisms underlying large scale functional diversification along the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to characterize spontaneous network activity between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus induced under conditions of partial or complete blockade of GABAergic inhibition (i.e. disinhibition).
Results:\hspace{0.6em} Using field recordings from the CA3 and CA1 fields of hippocampal slices from adult rats I found that ventral compared with dorsal hippocampus slices displayed higher propensity for and higher frequency of occurrence of spontaneous field potentials (spfps) at every level of disinhibition. Also NMDA receptor-depended spfps (spfps-nmda) occurred with higher probability more frequently and were larger in the ventral compared with the dorsal hippocampus. Importantly, blockade of GABAB receptors produced a stronger effect in enhancing the probability of generation of spfps and spfps-nmda in the dorsal compared with the ventral hippocampal slices and increased spfps-nmda only in dorsal slices.
Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} These results demonstrate a higher intrinsic neuronal excitability of the ventral compared with the dorsal local circuitry with the considerable contribution of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, the GABAB receptors control the total and the NMDA receptor-dependent excitation much less effectively in the ventral part of the hippocampus. It is proposed that NMDA and GABAB receptors significantly contribute to differentiate local network dynamics between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus with important implications in the information processing performed along the long hippocampal axis.},

  abstract = {Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are released at the active zone (AZ), a specialized region of the presynaptic plasma membrane organized by a highly interconnected network of multidomain proteins called the cytomatrix of the active zone (CAZ). Two core components of the CAZ are the large, highly homologous scaffolding proteins Bassoon and Piccolo, whose function is not well understood. To investigate their role in synaptic transmission, we established the small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated in vivo knockdown (KD) of Bassoon and Piccolo at the rat calyx of Held synapse. KD of Bassoon and Piccolo, separately or simultaneously, did not affect basic SV release. However, short-term depression (STD) was prominently increased by the KD of Bassoon, whereas KD of Piccolo only had a minor effect. The observed alterations in STD were readily explained by reduced SV replenishment in synapses deficient in either of the proteins. Thus, the regulation of SV refilling during ongoing synaptic activity is a shared function of Bassoon and Piccolo, although Bassoon appears to be more efficient. Moreover, we observed the recruitment of slowly-releasing SVs of the readily-releasable pool (RRP), which are normally not available for action potential-induced release, during high-frequency stimulation in Piccolo-deficient calyces. Therefore, the results obtained in the present study suggest a novel and specific role for Piccolo in the organization of the subpools of the RRP.},

  abstract = {To study the effects of stochastic ion channel fluctuations on neural dynamics, several numerical implementation methods have been proposed. Gillespie's method for Markov Chains (MC) simulation is highly accurate, yet it becomes computationally intensive in the regime of a high number of channels. Many recent works aim to speed simulation time using the Langevin-based Diffusion Approximation (DA). Under this common theoretical approach, each implementation differs in how it handles various numerical difficulties\textemdash{}such as bounding of state variables to [0,1]. Here we review and test a set of the most recently published DA implementations (Goldwyn et al., 2011; Linaro et al., 2011; Dangerfield et al., 2012; Orio and Soudry, 2012; Schmandt and Gal{\'a}n, 2012; G{\"u}ler, 2013; Huang et al., 2013a), comparing all of them in a set of numerical simulations that assess numerical accuracy and computational efficiency on three different models: (1) the original Hodgkin and Huxley model, (2) a model with faster sodium channels, and (3) a multi-compartmental model inspired in granular cells. We conclude that for a low number of channels (usually below 1000 per simulated compartment) one should use MC\textemdash{}which is the fastest and most accurate method. For a high number of channels, we recommend using the method by Orio and Soudry (2012), possibly combined with the method by Schmandt and Gal{\'a}n (2012) for increased speed and slightly reduced accuracy. Consequently, MC modeling may be the best method for detailed multicompartment neuron models\textemdash{}in which a model neuron with many thousands of channels is segmented into many compartments with a few hundred channels.},

  abstract = {Several forms of depolarization-induced plasticity in inhibitory transmission have been reported to occur in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), namely depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), depolarization-induced potentiation of inhibition (DPI), and rebound potentiation (RP). Here, we describe another form of synaptic plasticity for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission in PCs. Immediately following depolarization trains in a PC, evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) changed their direction from outward to inward currents under a recording condition in which eIPSCs were elicited as an outward current. Subsequently, the eIPSC amplitude remained depressed (depolarization-induced depression of inhibition [DDI]) for more than 20 min under the blockade of cannabinoid and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated DSI and DPI, respectively. This DDI was completely abolished by intracellular infusion of the fast Ca2+-chelating agent BAPTA and by inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Furthermore, DDI was strongly suppressed by calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) blockers, while an inhibitor of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) partially blocked DDI during the early phase. Exogenous GABA-induced inhibition of spontaneous spike activity was attenuated in \textasciitilde{}50\% of the PCs by climbing fiber stimulation-induced depolarization. These results suggest that activation of both CaCCs and CCCs was necessary for alteration of [Cl-]i after activation of CaMKII following elevation of [Ca2+]i in PCs. DDI may provide another mechanism for regulation of inhibitory inputs to PCs within the neuronal networks of the cerebellar cortex.},

However, the anatomical configuration of newly established circuits, the types and numbers of neurons that form new synaptic connections, and the effect of sensory experience on synaptic connectivity in the olfactory bulb remain poorly understood. Using in vivo electroporation and monosynaptic tracing, we show that postnatal-born granule cells form synaptic connections with centrifugal inputs and mitral/tufted cells in the mouse olfactory bulb. In addition, newly born granule cells receive extensive input from local inhibitory short axon cells, a poorly understood cell population. The connectivity of short axon cells shows clustered organization, and their synaptic input onto newborn granule cells dramatically and selectively expands with odor stimulation. Our findings suggest that sensory experience promotes the synaptic integration of new neurons into cell type-specific olfactory circuits.},

  abstract = {Sixty-five percent of Americans are over-weight. While the neuroendocrine controls of energy homeostasis are well known, how sensory systems respond to and are impacted by obesity is scantily understood. The main accepted function of the olfactory system is to provide an internal depiction of our external chemical environment, starting from the detection of chemosensory cues. We hypothesized that the system additionally functions to encode internal chemistry via the detection of chemicals that are important indicators of metabolic state. We here uncovered that the olfactory bulb (OB) subserves as an internal sensor of metabolism via insulin-induced modulation of the potassium channel Kv1.3. Using an adult slice preparation of the olfactory bulb, we found that evoked neural activity in Kv1.3-expressing mitral cells is enhanced following acute insulin application. Insulin mediated changes in mitral cell excitability are predominantly due to the modulation of Kv1.3 channels as evidenced by the lack of effect in slices from Kv1.3-null mice. Moreover, a selective Kv1.3 peptide blocker (ShK186) inhibits more than 80\% of the outward current in parallel voltage-clamp studies, whereby insulin significantly decreases the peak current magnitude without altering the kinetics of inactivation or deactivation. Mice that were chronically administered insulin using intranasal delivery approaches exhibited either an elevation in basal firing frequency or fired a single cluster of action potentials. Following chronic administration of the hormone, mitral cells were inhibited by application of acute insulin rather than excited. Mice made obese through a diet of ,32\% fat exhibited prominent changes in mitral cell action potential shape and clustering behavior, whereby the subsequent response to acute insulin stimulation was either attenuated or completely absent. Our results implicate an inappropriate neural function of olfactory sensors following exposure to chronic levels of the hormone insulin (diabetes) or increased body weight (obesity).},

Three-dimensional immunostaining in the mouse brain has been hampered by poor penetration. For this reason, we have developed a method that allows for entire hemispheres of the mouse brain to be stained using commercially available antibodies. Brains stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein, doublecortin and nestin were imaged in threedimensions using optical projection tomography and serial two-photon tomography. This staining method is simple, using a combination of heat, time and specimen preparation procedures readily available, so that it can be easily implemented without the need for specialized equipment, making it accessible to most laboratories.},

  abstract = {Efficient intracellular transport is essential for healthy cellular function and structural integrity, and problems in this pathway can lead to neuronal cell death and disease. To spatially and temporally evaluate how transport defects are initiated, we adapted a primary neuronal culture system from Drosophila larval brains to visualize the movement dynamics of several cargos/organelles along a 90 micron axonal neurite over time. All six vesicles/organelles imaged showed robust bidirectional motility at both day 1 and day 2. Reduction of motor proteins decreased the movement of vesicles/organelles with increased numbers of neurite blocks. Neuronal growth was also perturbed with reduction of motor proteins. Strikingly, we found that all blockages were not fixed, permanent blocks that impeded transport of vesicles as previously thought, but that some blocks were dynamic clusters of vesicles that resolved over time. Taken together, our findings suggest that nonresolving blocks may likely initiate deleterious pathways leading to death and degeneration, while resolving blocks may be benign. Therefore evaluating the spatial and temporal characteristics of vesicle transport has important implications for our understanding of how transport defects can affect other pathways to initiate death and degeneration.},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) influences a vast array of phenomena in cortical systems. It alters many ionic conductances and neuronal firing behavior, often by regulating membrane potential oscillations in populations of cells. Synaptic inhibition has crucial roles in many forms of oscillation, and cholinergic mechanisms regulate both oscillations and synaptic inhibition. In vitro investigations using bath-application of cholinergic receptor agonists, or bulk tissue electrical stimulation to release endogenous ACh, have led to insights into cholinergic function, but questions remain because of the relative lack of selectivity of these forms of stimulation. To investigate the effects of selective release of ACh on interneurons and oscillations, we used an optogenetic approach in which the light-sensitive non-selective cation channel, Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), was virally delivered to cholinergic projection neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBB) of adult mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter. Acute hippocampal slices obtained from these animals weeks later revealed ChR2 expression in cholinergic axons. Brief trains of blue light pulses delivered to untreated slices initiated bursts of ACh-evoked, inhibitory post-synaptic currents (L-IPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells that lasted for 10's of seconds after the light stimulation ceased. L-IPSC occurred more reliably in slices treated with eserine and a very low concentration of 4-AP, which were therefore used in most experiments. The rhythmic, LIPSCs were driven primarily by muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs), and could be suppressed by endocannabinoid release from pyramidal cells. Finally, low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) of local field potentials (LFPs) were significantly crosscorrelated with the L-IPSCs, and reversal of the LFPs near s. pyramidale confirmed that the LFPs were driven by perisomatic inhibition. This optogenetic approach may be a useful complementary technique in future investigations of endogenous ACh effects.},

  abstract = {Low frequency theta band oscillations (4\textendash{}8 Hz) are thought to provide a timing mechanism for hippocampal place cell firing and to mediate the formation of spatial memory. In rodents, hippocampal theta has been shown to play an important role in encoding a new environment during spatial navigation, but a similar functional role of hippocampal theta in humans has not been firmly established. To investigate this question, we recorded healthy participants' brain responses with a 160channel whole-head MEG system as they performed two training sets of a virtual Morris water maze task. Environment layouts (except for platform locations) of the two sets were kept constant to measure theta activity during spatial learning in new and familiar environments. In line with previous findings, left hippocampal/parahippocampal theta showed more activation navigating to a hidden platform relative to random swimming. Consistent with our hypothesis, right hippocampal/parahippocampal theta was stronger during the first training set compared to the second one. Notably, theta in this region during the first training set correlated with spatial navigation performance across individuals in both training sets. These results strongly argue for the functional importance of right hippocampal theta in initial encoding of configural properties of an environment during spatial navigation. Our findings provide important evidence that right hippocampal/parahippocampal theta activity is associated with environmental encoding in the human brain.

  abstract = {From an anatomical point of view the neocortex is subdivided into up to six layers depending on the cortical area. This subdivision has been described already by Meynert and Brodmann in the late 19/early 20. century and is mainly based on cytoarchitectonic features such as the size and location of the pyramidal cell bodies. Hence, cortical lamination is originally an anatomical concept based on the distribution of excitatory neuron. However, it has become apparent in recent years that apart from the layerspecific differences in morphological features, many functional properties of neurons are also dependent on cortical layer or cell type. Such functional differences include changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic activity by neuromodulatory transmitters. Many of these neuromodulators are released from axonal afferents from subcortical brain regions while others are released intrinsically. In this review we aim to describe layer- and cell-type specific differences in the effects of neuromodulator receptors in excitatory neurons in layers 2\textendash{}6 of different cortical areas. We will focus on the neuromodulator systems using adenosine, acetylcholine, dopamine, and orexin/hypocretin as examples because these neuromodulator systems show important differences in receptor type and distribution, mode of release and functional mechanisms and effects. We try to summarize how layer- and cell type-specific neuromodulation may affect synaptic signaling in cortical microcircuits.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {2050-084X},
  abstract = {We investigated the structural development of superficial-layers of medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum in rats. The grid-layout and cholinergic-innervation of calbindin-positive pyramidal-cells in layer-2 emerged around birth while reelin-positive stellate-cells were scattered throughout development. Layer-3 and parasubiculum neurons had a transient calbindin-expression, which declined with age. Early postnatally, layer-2 pyramidal but not stellate-cells co-localized with doublecortin \textendash{} a marker of immature neurons \textendash{} suggesting delayed functional-maturation of pyramidal-cells. Three observations indicated a dorsal-to-ventral maturation of entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum: (i) calbindin-expression in layer-3 neurons decreased progressively from dorsal-to-ventral, (ii) doublecortin in layer-2 calbindin-positive-patches disappeared dorsally before ventrally, and (iii) wolframin-expression emerged earlier in dorsal than ventral parasubiculum. The early appearance of calbindin-pyramidal-grid-organization in layer-2 suggests that this pattern is instructed by genetic information rather than experience. Superficial-layer-microcircuits mature earlier in dorsal entorhinal cortex, where small spatial-scales are represented. Maturation of ventral-entorhinal-microcircuits \textendash{} representing larger spatial-scales \textendash{} follows later around the onset of exploratory behavior.
          , 
            Many animals, from rats to humans, need to navigate their environments to find food or shelter. This ability relies on a kind of memory known as spatial memory, which provides a map of the outside world within the animal's brain. Specifically, cells in a part of the brain called the medial entorhinal cortex act like the grids present on a map, and are known as grid cells. Other cells in this region represent boundaries in the environment and are known as border cells. These cells and other cells connect to each other to make the spatial memory circuit.
            Previous research had reported that the grid cells were not present in the very early stages of an animal's life. It was also not clear how the different cell types involved in spatial memory develop after birth. Ray and Brecht have now studied rats and found that certain characteristic structures in the circuit are present at birth. For example, cells that were most likely to become grid cells, were already laid out in a grid, indicating that this layout is instructed by genetic information rather than experience.
            Ray and Brecht also found that the cells that most likely become grid cells matured later than the cells that most likely become border cells. Further analysis then revealed that the circuits in the top part of the medial entorhinal cortex, which represents nearby areas, matured earlier than those in the bottom part of this region, which represent farther areas. These findings could therefore explain why rats explore nearby areas earlier in life before going on to explore further away areas at later stages.
            More work is needed to characterize other components of the neural circuits involved in spatial memory to provide a complete understanding of how these memories are formed. Future experiments could also ask if encouraging young rats to explore a wider area can cause the circuits to mature more quickly.},

  abstract = {Network oscillations across and within brain areas are critical for learning and performance in memory tasks. While a large amount of work has focused on the generation of neural oscillations, their effects on neuronal populations' spiking activity and information encoding is less known. Here, we use computational modeling and in vivo recording to demonstrate that a shift in sub-threshold resonance can interact with oscillating input to ensure that networks of neurons properly encode new information represented in external inputs to the weights of recurrent synaptic connections. Using a neuronal network model, we find that due to an input-current dependent shift in their resonance response, individual neurons in a network will arrange their phases of firing to represent varying strengths of their respective inputs. As networks encode information, neurons fire more synchronously, and this effect limits the extent to which further "learning" (in the form of changes in synaptic strength) can occur. We also demonstrate that sequential patterns of neuronal firing can be accurately stored in the network; these sequences are later reproduced without external input (in the context of sub-threshold oscillations) in both the forward and reverse directions (as has been observed following learning in vivo). To test whether a similar mechanism could act in vivo, we show that periodic stimulation of hippocampal neurons coordinates network activity and functional connectivity in a frequency-dependent manner. We conclude that sub-threshold resonance provides a plausible network-level mechanism to accurately encode and retrieve information without over-strengthening connections between neurons.},

  volume = {373},
  issn = {0302-766X, 1432-0878},
  abstract = {A quantitative computational theory of the operation of the hippocampus as an episodic memory system is described. The CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network (1) to enable rapid one-trial associations between any spatial location (place in rodents or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward and (2) to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The theory is extended to associations between time and object or reward to implement temporal order memory, which is also important in episodic memory. The dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by competitive learning to create sparse representations producing, for example, neurons with place-like fields from entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule cells generate, by the very small number of mossy fibre connections to CA3, a randomizing pattern separation effect that is important during learning but not recall and that separates out the patterns represented by CA3 firing as being very different from each other. This is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory system in which each memory must be kept distinct from other memories. The direct perforant path input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate for providing the cue for recall in CA3 but not for learning. The CA1 recodes information from CA3 to set up associatively learned backprojections to the neocortex to allow the subsequent retrieval of information to the neocortex, giving a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical and neocortical-neocortical backprojections. Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion analyses and hippocampal NMDA receptor knockouts are described and support the theory.},

These circuits could be activated\textemdash{}in ways that reveal circuit function or restore function after disease\textemdash{}by an artificial stimulation system that is capable of independently driving local groups of neurons. Here we present a simple custom microscope called ProjectorScope 1 that incorporates off-the-shelf parts and a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector to stimulate surface brain regions that express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). In principle, local optogenetic stimulation of the brain surface with optical projection systems might not produce local activation of a highly interconnected network like the cortex, because of potential stimulation of axons of passage or extended dendritic trees. However, here we demonstrate that the combination of virally mediated ChR2 expression levels and the light intensity of ProjectorScope 1 is capable of producing local spatial activation with a resolution of {$\sim$}200\textendash{}300 {$\mu$}m. We use the system to examine the role of cortical activity in the experience-dependent emergence of motion selectivity in immature ferret visual cortex. We find that optogenetic cortical activation alone\textemdash{}without visual stimulation\textemdash{}is sufficient to produce increases in motion selectivity, suggesting the presence of a sharpening mechanism that does not require precise spatiotemporal activation of the visual system.

Previous studies suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) may have a role in reproducibly selecting the hippocampal representation of an environment. To examine how ongoing MEC activity is continually integrated by the hippocampus, we performed transient unilateral optogenetic inactivations of the MEC while simultaneously recording place cell activity in CA1. Inactivation of the MEC caused a partial remapping in the CA1 population, without diminishing the degree of spatial tuning across the active cell assembly. These changes remained stable irrespective of intermittent disruption of MEC input, indicating that while MEC input is integrated over long time scales to bias the active population, there are mechanisms for stabilizing the population of active neurons independent of the MEC. We find that MEC inputs to the hippocampus shape its ongoing activity by biasing the participation of the neurons in the active network, thereby influencing how the hippocampus selectively represents information.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {2050-084X},
  abstract = {The sense of touch comprises multiple sensory channels that each conveys characteristic signals during interactions with objects. These neural signals must then be integrated in such a way that behaviorally relevant information about the objects is preserved. To understand the process of integration, we implement a simple computational model that describes how the responses of neurons in somatosensory cortex\textemdash{}recorded from awake, behaving monkeys\textemdash{}are shaped by the peripheral input, reconstructed using simulations of neuronal populations that reproduce natural spiking responses in the nerve with millisecond precision. First, we find that the strength of cortical responses is driven by one population of nerve fibers (rapidly adapting) whereas the timing of cortical responses is shaped by the other (Pacinian). Second, we show that input from these sensory channels is integrated in an optimal fashion that exploits the disparate response behaviors of different fiber types.
          , 
            Our sense of touch depends upon receptors in our skin that send signals to the brain about the objects with which we interact. Different types of touch receptors respond in different ways when we grasp and manipulate objects; for example, by altering the strength of their response or its timing.
            Saal et al. have now investigated how neurons in a part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex, which processes touch signals from the hand, respond to the information from the different receptor types. First, recordings were made of the electrical activity of the touch receptors and the neurons in the brain of monkeys. Using this data, Saal et al. built computer models that allow the response of neurons in the brain to be predicted from the responses of the touch receptors.
            The models showed that signals from different types of touch receptors shape the response of neurons in the brain in different ways. One receptor type controls how strong a neuron's response will be, while another one controls the precise timing of the response. Further investigation revealed that this way of combining the signals from the different receptors preserves as much information as possible about objects and thereby helps the brain to process information acquired by touch quickly and efficiently.
            Future experiments will examine how touch is represented in two structures that lie between the receptors and the somatosensory cortex: one in the brainstem, the other in a brain region called the thalamus.},

Antigen PSD-95, also present in mouse and rat PSDs, was virtually absent from cytoplasm, myelin, mitochondria, and microsomes from rodent or bovine brain . Antigens PSD-82 and PSD-72 were present in all subcellular fractions from bovine brain, especially in mitochondria, but were almost absent from rodent brain . The antiserum also contained low-affinity antibodies against tubulin . (b) Immunohistochemical studies were performed in mouse and rat brain, where antigen PSD-95 accounted for 90\% of the antiserum binding after adsorption with purified brain tubulin . At the light microscope level, antibody binding was observed only in those regions of the brain where synapses are known to be present. No reaction was observed in myelinated tracts, in the neuronal cytoplasm, or in nonneuronal cells. Strong reactivity was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum . Experimental lesions, such as ablation of the rat entorhinal cortex or intraventricular injection of kainic acid, which led to a major loss of PSD in well-defined areas of the hippocampal formation, caused a correlative decrease in immunoreactivity in these areas. Abnormal patterns of immunohistochemical staining correlated with abnormal synaptic patterns in the cerebella of reeler and staggerer mouse mutants. (c) At the electron microscopic level, immunoreactivity was detectable only in PSD . The antibody did not bind to myelin, mitochondria or plasma membranes . (d) The results indicate that antigen PSD-95 is located predominantly or exclusively in PSD and can be used as a marker during subcellular fractionation.

  abstract = {Quantification of nerve fibers in peripheral and central nervous systems is important for the understanding of neuronal function, organization and pathological changes. However, current methods to quantify nerve fibers are resource-intensive and often provide an indirect measurement of nerve fiber density. Here, we describe an automated and efficient method for nerve fiber quantification, which we developed by making use of widely available software and analytical techniques, including Hessian-based feature extraction in NIH ImageJ and line intensity scan analysis. The combined use of these analytical tools through an automated routine enables reliable detection and quantification of nerve fibers from low magnification, non-uniformly labeled epifluorescence images. This allows for time-efficient determination of nerve density and also comparative analysis in large brain structures, such as hippocampus or between various regions of neural circuitry. Using this method, we have obtained accurate measurements of cholinergic fiber density in hippocampus and a large area of cortex in mouse brain sections immunolabeled with an antibody against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). The density values are comparable among animals tested, showing a high degree of reproducibility. Because our method can be performed at relatively low cost and in large tissue sections where nerve fibers can be labeled by various antibodies or visualized by expression of reporter proteins, such as green fluorescent protein in transgenic mice, we expect our method to be broadly useful in both research and clinical investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first method to reliably quantify nerve fibers through a rapid and automated protocol.},

The mouse needs to visually recognize the target location and stay there for a short period of time to receive the reward. Transient pharmacological blockade of fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the dorsal hippocampus dramatically and reversibly impaired performance of this task. Encoding and updating of virtual cued goal location memory was impaired in mice deficient in the postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank2, a mouse model of autism that exhibits impaired spatial learning in a real environment. These results highlight the crucial roles of the dorsal hippocampus and postsynaptic protein complexes in spatial learning and navigation in VR.},

  abstract = {What are the computational laws of hippocampal activity? In this paper we argue for the slowness principle as a fundamental processing paradigm behind hippocampal place cell firing. We present six different studies from the experimental literature, performed with real-life rats, that we replicated in computer simulations. Each of the chosen studies allows rodents to develop stable place fields and then examines a distinct property of the established spatial encoding: adaptation to cue relocation and removal; directional dependent firing in the linear track and open field; and morphing and scaling the environment itself. Simulations are based on a hierarchical Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) network topped by a principal component analysis (ICA) output layer. The slowness principle is shown to account for the main findings of the presented experimental studies. The SFA network generates its responses using raw visual input only, which adds to its biological plausibility but requires experiments performed in light conditions. Future iterations of the model will thus have to incorporate additional information, such as path integration and grid cell activity, in order to be able to also replicate studies that take place during darkness.},

  abstract = {Precisely how rhythms support neuronal communication remains obscure. We investigated interregional coordination of gamma oscillations using high-density electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We found that 30\textendash{}80 Hz gamma dominated CA1 local field potentials (LFPs) on the descending phase of CA1 theta waves during navigation, with 60\textendash{}120 Hz gamma at the theta peak. These signals corresponded to CA3 and entorhinal input, respectively. Above 50 Hz, interregional phase-synchronization of principal cell spikes occurred mostly for LFPs in the axonal target domain. CA1 pyramidal cells were phase-locked mainly to fast gamma ({$>$}100 Hz) LFP patterns restricted to CA1, which were strongest at the theta trough. While theta phase coordination of spiking across entorhinal-hippocampal regions depended on memory demands, LFP gamma patterns below 100 Hz in the hippocampus were consistently layer specific and largely reflected afferent activity. Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {2050-084X},
  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent illness that can be precipitated by acute or chronic stress. Studies of patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers have identified Wfs1 mutations as causative for MDD. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in depression and behavioral resilience, although the cell types and circuits in the mPFC that moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress have not been determined. Here, we report that deletion of Wfs1 from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells impairs the ability of the mPFC to suppress stress-induced depressive behaviors, and results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic\textendash{}pituitary\textendash{}adrenal axis and altered accumulation of important growth and neurotrophic factors. Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of depressive behaviors and suggest that dysfunction in these cells may contribute to the clinical relationship between stress and depression.
          , 
            Around 16\% of people will experience an episode of major depression at some point in their lives, with symptoms including a loss of motivation, a reduced enjoyment of previously pleasurable activities, and disturbances in sleep and appetite. Multiple genes and environmental factors have been implicated in depression, and one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disorder is exposure to stress.
            Stress and depression affect many of the same brain regions, most notably the prefrontal cortex\textemdash{}an area that is involved in decision making, problem solving and regulating emotions. Shrestha et al. therefore reasoned that a good way of obtaining insights into the relationship between stress and depression would be to study prefrontal cortex cells that express genes that have been linked to depression.
            One such gene is Wfs1. Mutations in this gene cause a rare disorder called Wolfram syndrome, in which affected individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that often include severe depression. Shrestha et al. identified a specific population of cells in the prefrontal cortex that express Wfs1. When subjected to a stressful event, such as being restrained, mice that had been genetically modified to lack this gene in their prefrontal cortex were more likely to exhibit depression-like behaviors than non-modified mice. The genetically modified mice also released more stress hormones when restrained and produced different amounts of a number of proteins that regulate the growth and signaling of neurons.
            Shrestha et al. propose that these proteins act on neural circuits that control how the mice respond to stress. Furthermore, changes in the levels or the distribution of these proteins may increase the likelihood that a stressful event will trigger behaviors associated with depression. Further experiments are required to investigate the possibility that using drugs to manipulate cells that express Wfs1 could protect against the harmful effects of stress, or even treat existing episodes of depression.},

  volume = {12},

  abstract = {Optogenetics offers many advantages in terms of cell-type specificity, allowing to investigate functional connectivity between different brain areas at high spatial and neural population selectivity. In order to obtain simultaneous optical control and electrical readout of neural activity, devices called ``optrodes'' are employed. They are typically composed of a linear array of microelectrodes integrated on a slender probe shafts combined with flat-cleaved optical fibers (FF) placed above the recording sites. However, due to tissue absorption and scattering, light delivered by the FF unevenly illuminates the region of interest. This issue is of particular relevance when cellular populations are disposed along the dorso-ventral axis, such as in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where cortical layers are aligned vertically. The study presented here aims at using tapered optical fibers (TFs) in combination with a 16-electrode neural probe to better access neural populations distributed along the dorso-ventral axis in the mPFC of newborn mice, restricting light delivery over a specific portion of the cortical layer of interest. Half of the TF surface is coated with a reflecting metal blocking the light to enable light delivery from one side of the probe's shaft only, with the probe base being designed to host the fiber without interfering with the wire-bonds that connect the recording sites to a printed circuit board. Monte-Carlo simulations have been implemented to define the relative TF-probe position and to identify the light intensity distribution above the recording sites. In vivo recordings indicate that simultaneous optical stimulation and electrical readout of neural activity in the mPFC benefit from the use of the engineered TF-based optrode in terms of a more uniform light distribution along the dorso-ventral axis and the possibility of restricting light delivery to a subset of electrical recording sites of interest.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1662-5188},
  abstract = {A spiking neural network model is described for learning to discriminate among spatial patterns in an unsupervised manner. The network anatomy consists of source neurons that are activated by external inputs, a reservoir that resembles a generic cortical layer with an excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network and a sink layer of neurons for readout. Synaptic plasticity in the form of STDP is imposed on all the excitatory and inhibitory synapses at all times. While long-term excitatory STDP enables sparse and efficient learning of the salient features in inputs, inhibitory STDP enables this learning to be stable by establishing a balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents at each neuron in the network. The synaptic weights between source and reservoir neurons form a basis set for the input patterns. The neural trajectories generated in the reservoir due to input stimulation and lateral connections between reservoir neurons can be readout by the sink layer neurons. This activity is used for adaptation of synapses between reservoir and sink layer neurons. A new measure called the discriminability index (DI) is introduced to compute if the network can discriminate between old patterns already presented in an initial training session. The DI is also used to compute if the network adapts to new patterns without losing its ability to discriminate among old patterns. The final outcome is that the network is able to correctly discriminate between all patterns\textemdash{}both old and new. This result holds as long as inhibitory synapses employ STDP to continuously enable current balance in the network. The results suggest a possible direction for future investigation into how spiking neural networks could address the stability-plasticity question despite having continuous synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {The developing brain is formed through an orchestrated pattern of neuronal migration, leading to the formation of heterogeneous functional regions in the adult. Several proteins and pathways have been identified as mediators of developmental neuronal migration and cell positioning. However, these pathways do not cease to be functionally relevant after the embryonic and early postnatal period; instead, they switch from guiding cells, to guiding synapses. The outcome of synaptic guidance determines the strength and plasticity of neuronal networks by creating a scalable functional architecture that is sculpted by cues from the internal and external environment. Reelin is a multifunctional signal that coordinates cortical and subcortical morphogenesis during development and regulates structural plasticity in adulthood and aging. Gain or loss of function in reelin or its receptors has the potential to influence synaptic strength and patterns of connectivity, with consequences for memory and cognition. The current review highlights similarities in the signaling cascades that modulate neuronal positioning during development, and synaptic plasticity in the adult, with a focus on reelin, a glycoprotein that is increasingly recognized for its dual role in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits.},

Of particular concern is the potential for heat induced by prolonged optical stimulation. We demonstrate that high-intensity light, delivered through an optical fiber, is capable of elevating firing rate locally, even in the absence of opsin expression. Predicting the severity and spatial extent of any temperature increase during optogenetic stimulation is therefore of considerable importance. Here, we describe a realistic model that simulates light and heat propagation during optogenetic experiments. We validated the model by comparing predicted and measured temperature changes in vivo. We further demonstrate the utility of this model by comparing predictions for various wavelengths of light and fiber sizes, as well as testing methods for reducing heat effects on neural targets in vivo.},

  volume = {7},

  abstract = {Sympathetic nerves conveying central commands to regulate visceral functions often display activities in synchronous bursts. To understand how individual fibers fire synchronously, we establish ``oligofiber recording techniques'' to record ``several'' nerve fiber activities simultaneously, using in vitro splanchnic sympathetic nerve\textendash{}thoracic spinal cord preparations of neonatal rats as experimental models. While distinct spike potentials were easily recorded from collagenase-dissociated sympathetic fibers, a problem arising from synchronous nerve discharges is a higher incidence of complex waveforms resulted from spike overlapping. Because commercial softwares do not provide an explicit solution for spike overlapping, a series of custom-made LabVIEW programs incorporated with MATLAB scripts was therefore written for spike sorting. Spikes were represented as data points after waveform feature extraction and automatically grouped by k-means clustering followed by principal component analysis (PCA) to verify their waveform homogeneity. For dissimilar waveforms with exceeding Hotelling's T2 distances from the cluster centroids, a unique data-based subtraction algorithm (SA) was used to determine if they were the complex waveforms resulted from superimposing a spike pattern close to the cluster centroid with the other signals that could be observed in original recordings. In comparisons with commercial software, higher accuracy was achieved by analyses using our algorithms for the synthetic data that contained synchronous spiking and complex waveforms. Moreover, both T2-selected and SA-retrieved spikes were combined as unit activities. Quantitative analyses were performed to evaluate if unit activities truly originated from single fibers. We conclude that applications of our programs can help to resolve synchronous sympathetic nerve discharges (SND).},

  title = {Theta-Modulation Drives the Emergence of Network-Wide Connectivity Patterns Underlying Replay in a Model of Hippocampal Place Cells},
  abstract = {Summary
          Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as ``replays''. It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are ``transferred'' from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.},

Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated two clones that specifically interact with the three isoforms of Rab6 present in mammalian cells (Rab6A, A{$f$} and B). The cDNAs encode two proteins of 976 and 1120 amino acids (calculated molecular mass of 112 and 128 kDa, respectively) that we named Rab6IP2A and Rab6IP2B (for Rab6 Interacting Protein 2). The two proteins likely correspond to spliced variants of the same gene. Rab6IP2s have no significant homology with other known proteins, including Rab effectors or partners. They are ubiquitously expressed, mostly cytosolic and found in high molecular mass complexes in brain cytosol. We show that Rab6IP2s can be recruited on Golgi membranes in a Rab6:GTP-dependent manner. The overexpression of any form of Rab6IP2 has no detectable effect on the secretory pathway. In contrast, the retrograde transport of the Shiga toxin B subunit between the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex is partly inhibited in cells overexpressing the Rab6-binding domain of Rab6IP2. Our data suggest that Rab6IP2s is involved in the pathway regulated by Rab6A{$f$}.},

  abstract = {Continuous attractor network models of grid formation posit that recurrent connectivity between grid cells controls their patterns of co-activation. Grid cells from a common module exhibit stable offsets in their periodic spatial tuning curves across environments, which may reflect recurrent connectivity or correlated sensory inputs. Here we explore whether cell-cell relationships predicted by attractor models persist during sleep states in which spatially informative sensory inputs are absent. We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per pair and collectively, we found preserved patterns of spiketime correlations across waking, REM, and non-REM sleep, which reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these cells during active exploration. The preservation of cell-cell relationships across states was not explained by theta oscillations or CA1 activity. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity within the grid cell network drives grid cell activity across behavioral states.},

Here, rats freely locomoted while performing an object-location task designed to test hippocampus-dependent spatial associative memory. Rhythmic activity in theta, beta, slow gamma, and fast gamma frequency ranges were observed in both action potentials and local field potentials (LFPs) across four main hippocampal subregions. Several patterns of LFP oscillations corresponded to overt behavior (e.g., increased dentate gyrusCA3 beta coherence during stationary moments and CA1-subiculum theta coherence during locomotion). In comparison, slow gamma (\$40 Hz) oscillations throughout the hippocampus related most specifically to object-location associative memory encoding rather than overt behavior. The results help to untangle how hippocampal oscillations relate to both memory and motion and single out slow gamma oscillations as a distinguishing correlate of spatial associative memory.},

  abstract = {Phase consistent neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in electrophysiological recordings, and they may reflect networks of phase-coupled neuronal populations oscillating at different frequencies. Because neuronal oscillations may reflect rhythmic modulations of neuronal excitability, phase-coupled oscillatory networks could be the functional building block for routing information through the brain. Current techniques are not suited for directly characterizing such networks. To be able to extract phase-coupled oscillatory networks we developed a new method, which characterizes networks by phase coupling between sites. Importantly, this method respects the fact that neuronal oscillations have energy in a range of frequencies. As a consequence, we characterize these networks by between-site phase relations that vary as a function of frequency, such as those that result from between-site temporal delays. Using human electrocorticographic recordings we show that our method can uncover phase-coupled oscillatory networks that show interesting patterns in their between-site phase relations, such as travelling waves. We validate our method by demonstrating it can accurately recover simulated networks from a realistic noisy environment. By extracting phase-coupled oscillatory networks and investigating patterns in their between-site phase relations we can further elucidate the role of oscillations in neuronal communication.

The objectives of this paper are (i) to develop and integrate a pipeline that goes from morphological feature extraction to classification and (ii) to assess and compare the accuracy of machine learning algorithms to classify neuron morphologies. The algorithms were trained on 430 digitally reconstructed neurons subjectively classified into layers and/or m-types using young and/or adult development state population of the somatosensory cortex in rats. For supervised algorithms, linear discriminant analysis provided better classification results in comparison with others. For unsupervised algorithms, the affinity propagation and the Ward algorithms provided slightly better results.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1662-5188},
  abstract = {Neuronal networks in rodent barrel cortex are characterized by stable low baseline firing rates. However, they are sensitive to the action potentials of single neurons as suggested by recent single-cell stimulation experiments that reported quantifiable behavioral responses in response to short spike trains elicited in single neurons. Hence, these networks are stable against internally generated fluctuations in firing rate but at the same time remain sensitive to similarly-sized externally induced perturbations. We investigated stability and sensitivity in a simple recurrent network of stochastic binary neurons and determined numerically the effects of correlation between the number of afferent (``in-degree'') and efferent (``out-degree'') connections in neurons. The key advance reported in this work is that anti-correlation between in-/out-degree distributions increased the stability of the network in comparison to networks with no correlation or positive correlations, while being able to achieve the same level of sensitivity. The experimental characterization of degree distributions is difficult because all pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons have to be identified and counted. We explored whether the statistics of network motifs, which requires the characterization of connections between small subsets of neurons, could be used to detect evidence for degree anti-correlations. We find that the sample frequency of the 3-neuron ``ring'' motif (1\textrightarrow2\textrightarrow3\textrightarrow1), can be used to detect degree anti-correlation for sub-networks of size 30 using about 50 samples, which is of significance because the necessary measurements are achievable experimentally in the near future. Taken together, we hypothesize that barrel cortex networks exhibit degree anti-correlations and specific network motif statistics.},

However, the presumed changes in glutamatergic inputs onto PV interneurons have not been tested directly. We treated mice with the NMDAR antagonist ketamine during the second postnatal week and investigated persistent cellular changes in the adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and immunohistochemistry. Parvalbumin expression in the mPFC was reduced in ketamine-treated (KET) mice, and {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid release onto pyramidal cells was reduced in layers 2/3, but not layer 5. Consistent with pyramidal cell disinhibition the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic inputs onto PV cells was also increased in KET mice. Furthermore, developmental ketamine treatment resulted in an increased NMDA:AMPA ratio in evoked synaptic currents and larger amplitudes of spontaneous NMDAR currents, indicating a homeostatic upregulation of NMDARs in PV interneurons. This upregulation was specific to NR2B subunits, without concomitant alterations in currents through NR2A subunits. These changes altered synaptic integration at PV cells during trains of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. These changes likely impact synaptic coincidence detection and impair cortical network function in the NMDAR antagonism model of schizophrenia.},

ChC connectivity allows for powerful yet precise modulation of large populations of pyramidal cells, suggesting ChCs have a critical role in brain functions. Dysfunctions in ChC connectivity are associated with brain disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia; however, whether this is causative, contributory or compensatory is not known. A likely stumbling block toward mechanistic discoveries and uncovering potential therapeutic targets is the apparent lack of rudimentary understanding of ChCs. For example, whether cortical ChCs are inhibitory or excitatory remains unresolved, and thus whether altered ChC activity results in altered inhibition or excitation is not clear. Recent studies have shed some light onto this excitation-inhibition controversy. In addition, new findings have identified preferential cell-type connectivities established by cortical ChCs, greatly expanding our understanding of the role of ChCs in the cortical microcircuit. Here we aim to bring more attention to ChC connectivity to better understand its role in neural circuits, address whether ChCs are inhibitory or excitatory in light of recent findings and discuss ChC dysfunctions in brain disorders.},

Moreover, neurons from different parts of that distribution were differentially modulated by sleep substates. Periods of nonREM sleep reduced the activity of high firing rate neurons and tended to upregulate firing of slow-firing neurons. By contrast, the effect of REM was to reduce firing rates across the entire rate spectrum. Microarousals, interspersed within nonREM epochs, increased firing rates of slow-firing neurons. The net result of sleep was to homogenize the firing rate distribution. These findings are at variance with current homeostatic models and provide a novel view of sleep in adjusting network excitability.},

  abstract = {Hippocampome.org is a comprehensive knowledge base of neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex). Although the hippocampal literature is remarkably information-rich, neuron properties are often reported with incompletely defined and notoriously inconsistent terminology, creating a formidable challenge for data integration. Our extensive literature mining and data reconciliation identified 122 neuron types based on neurotransmitter, axonal and dendritic patterns, synaptic specificity, electrophysiology, and molecular biomarkers. All {$\sim$}3700 annotated properties are individually supported by specific evidence ({$\sim$}14,000 pieces) in peer-reviewed publications. Systematic analysis of this unprecedented amount of machine-readable information reveals novel correlations among neuron types and properties, the potential connectivity of the full hippocampal circuitry, and outstanding knowledge gaps. User-friendly browsing and online querying of Hippocampome.org may aid design and interpretation of both experiments and simulations. This powerful, simple, and extensible neuron classification endeavor is unique in its detail, utility, and completeness.
          , 
            The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped region of the brain that is responsible for learning, emotions, and memory. Like other regions of the brain, it contains many types of neurons that send information to each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters across junctions known as synapses. Identifying all the different neuron types in the hippocampus is an important step towards understanding in detail how this brain region works.
            Thousands of articles have been published that attempt to characterize the neurons in the hippocampus, but many of these studies report only some of the properties of a new neuron type. It is also often difficult to compare the results of different studies, as many different approaches have been used to investigate neuron types, and different studies often use different terms to describe similar features.
            Wheeler et al. have now created a resource called Hippocampome.org that combines approximately 14,000 pieces of experimental evidence about neuron types in the rat hippocampus into a unified database. Analyzing these data has revealed about 3700 different neuron properties. By primarily considering the pattern formed by the branched axons and dendrites, the outputs and inputs that extend out of a neuron, Wheeler et al. have identified over a hundred different neuron types. This classification system also considers how selectively the neuron forms synapses with other cells and the identity of the neurotransmitter released by the neuron. In the future, other features of the neurons will also be incorporated into the system to help refine the classifications.
            All of this information is online and freely available at Hippocampome.org. This resource is expected to provide a solid basis for analyzing how the hippocampus works, by helping researchers to design and interpret experiments and simulations.},

  issn = {1662-5129},
  abstract = {Cholecystokinin (CCK)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons constitute the two major populations of perisomatic GABAergic neurons in the cortex and the hippocampus. As CCK- and PV-GABA neurons differ in an array of morphological, biochemical and electrophysiological features, it has been proposed that they form distinct inhibitory ensembles which differentially contribute to network oscillations and behavior. However, the relationship and balance between CCK- and PV-GABA neurons in the inhibitory networks of the brain is currently unclear as the distribution of these cells has never been compared on a large scale. Here, we systemically investigated the distribution of CCK- and PV-GABA cells across a wide number of discrete forebrain regions using an intersectional genetic approach. Our analysis revealed several novel trends in the distribution of these cells. While PV-GABA cells were more abundant overall, CCK-GABA cells outnumbered PV-GABA cells in several subregions of the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral temporal cortex. Interestingly, CCK-GABA cells were relatively more abundant in secondary/association areas of the cortex (V2, S2, M2, and AudD/AudV) than they were in corresponding primary areas (V1, S1, M1, and Aud1). The reverse trend was observed for PV-GABA cells. Our findings suggest that the balance between CCK- and PV-GABA cells in a given cortical region is related to the type of processing that area performs; inhibitory networks in the secondary cortex tend to favor the inclusion of CCK-GABA cells more than networks in the primary cortex. The intersectional genetic labeling approach employed in the current study expands upon the ability to study molecularly defined subsets of GABAergic neurons. This technique can be applied to the investigation of neuropathologies which involve disruptions to the GABAergic system, including schizophrenia, stress, maternal immune activation and autism.},

  issn = {10509631},
  abstract = {The perirhinal (PER) and lateral entorhinal (LEC) cortex form an anatomical link between the neocortex and the hippocampus. However, neocortical activity is transmitted through the PER and LEC to the hippocampus with a low probability, suggesting the involvement of the inhibitory network. This study explored the role of interneuron mediated inhibition, activated by electrical stimulation in the agranular insular cortex (AiP), in the deep layers of the PER and LEC. Activated synaptic input by AiP stimulation rarely evoked action potentials in the PER-LEC deep layer excitatory principal neurons, most probably because the evoked synaptic response consisted of a small excitatory and large inhibitory conductance. Furthermore, parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons - a subset of interneurons projecting onto the axo-somatic region of principal neurons - received synaptic input earlier than principal neurons, suggesting recruitment of feedforward inhibition. This synaptic input in PV interneurons evoked varying trains of action potentials, explaining the fast rising, long lasting synaptic inhibition received by deep layer principal neurons. Altogether, the excitatory input from the AiP onto deep layer principal neurons is overruled by strong feedforward inhibition. PV interneurons, with their fast, extensive stimulus-evoked firing, are able to deliver this fast evoked inhibition in principal neurons. This indicates an essential role for PV interneurons in the gating mechanism of the PER-LEC network.},

  shorttitle = {Controlling the Oscillation Phase through Precisely Timed Closed-Loop Optogenetic Stimulation},
  abstract = {Dynamic oscillatory coherence is believed to play a central role in flexible communication between brain circuits. To test this communication-through-coherence hypothesis, experimental protocols that allow a reliable control of phase-relations between neuronal populations are needed. In this modeling study, we explore the potential of closed-loop optogenetic stimulation for the control of functional interactions mediated by oscillatory coherence. The theory of non-linear oscillators predicts that the efficacy of local stimulation will depend not only on the stimulation intensity but also on its timing relative to the ongoing oscillation in the target area. Induced phase-shifts are expected to be stronger when the stimulation is applied within specific narrow phase intervals. Conversely, stimulations with the same or even stronger intensity are less effective when timed randomly. Stimulation should thus be properly phased with respect to ongoing oscillations (in order to optimally perturb them) and the timing of the stimulation onset must be determined by a real-time phase analysis of simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Here, we introduce an electrophysiologically calibrated model of Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-induced photocurrents, based on fits holding over two decades of light intensity. Through simulations of a neural population which undergoes coherent gamma oscillations\textemdash{}either spontaneously or as an effect of continuous optogenetic driving\textemdash{}we show that precisely-timed photostimulation pulses can be used to shift the phase of oscillation, even at transduction rates smaller than 25\%. We consider then a canonic circuit with two inter-connected neural populations oscillating with gamma frequency in a phase-locked manner. We demonstrate that photostimulation pulses applied locally to a single population can induce, if precisely phased, a lasting reorganization of the phase-locking pattern and hence modify functional interactions between the two populations.},

  volume = {259},

  abstract = {Background: The time-varying membrane potential of a cortical neuron contains important information about the network activity. Extracting this information requires separating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from single-trial membrane potential recordings without averaging across trials. New method: We propose a method to extract the time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to a neuron from a single-trial membrane potential recording. The method takes advantage of the differences in the time constants and the reversal potentials of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents, which allows the untangling of the two conductance types.
Results: We evaluate the applicability of the method on a leaky integrate-and-fire model neuron and find high quality of estimation of excitatory synaptic conductance changes and presynaptic population spikes. Application of the method to a real cortical neuron with known synaptic inputs in a brain slice returns high-quality estimation of the time course of the excitatory synaptic conductance. Application of the method to membrane potential recordings from a cortical pyramidal neuron of an intact brain reveals complex network activity.
Comparison with existing methods: Existing methods are based on repeated trials and thus are limited to estimating the statistical features of synaptic conductance changes, or, when based on single trials, are limited to special cases, have low temporal resolution, or are impractically complicated.
Conclusions: We propose and test an efficient method for estimating the full time course of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from single-trial membrane potential recordings. The method is sufficiently simple to ensure widespread use in neuroscience.},

  abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is implicated in directing and maintaining visual attention to locations in space. We hypothesized that the PPC also engages other cognitive processes in the transformation of behaviorally relevant visual inputs into appropriate actions, for example, monitoring of multiple locations, selection of responses to locations in space, and monitoring the outcome of response selections. We recorded single cells and local field potentials in the rat PPC during performance on a novel visuospatial attention (VSA) task that requires visually monitoring locations in space in order to make appropriate stimulus-guided locomotor responses. In each trial, rats attended to four locations on the floor of a maze. A randomly chosen location was briefly illuminated. Approach to the correct target location was followed by food reward. We observed that PPC activity correlated with multiple phases of the VSA task, including monitoring for stimulus onset, detection of a target, spatial location of the target, and target choice. A substantial proportion of cells with behavioral correlates were also modulated by outcome of the trial. Our analyses of local field potentials revealed strong oscillatory rhythms in the theta frequency band, and more than a third of PPC neurons were phase locked to theta oscillations. As in other brain regions, theta power correlated with running speed. Peak theta power was higher in superficial layers than deep layers providing evidence against volume conduction from the hippocampus. In addition, theta power was sensitive to the outcome of a choice. Theta power was significantly higher following incorrect choices compared with correct choices, possibly providing a prediction error signal. Our study provides evidence that the rat PPC has multiple roles in the translation of visual information into appropriate behavioral actions. VC 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

As levels of acetylcholine rise during active learning tasks, PV neurons become increasingly engaged in network dynamics. Conversely, impairment of either cholinergic or PV interneuron function induces learning deficits. Here, we examined PV interneurons in hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and their modulation by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). HC PV cells, visualized by crossing PV-CRE mice with Rosa26YFP mice, were anatomically identified as basket cells and PV bistratified cells in the stratum pyramidale; in stratum oriens, HC PV cells were electrophysiologically distinct from somatostatin-containing cells. With glutamatergic transmission pharmacologically blocked, mAChR activation enhanced PV cell excitability in both CA1 HC and PFC; however, CA1 HC PV cells exhibited a stronger postsynaptic depolarization than PFC PV cells. To delete M1 mAChRs genetically from PV interneurons, we created PV-M1 knockout mice by crossing PV-CRE and floxed M1 mice. The elimination of M1 mAChRs from PV cells diminished M1 mAChR immunoreactivity and muscarinic excitation of HC PV cells. Selective cholinergic activation of HC PV interneurons using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs technology enhanced the frequency and amplitude of inhibitory synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal cells.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1662-5188},
  abstract = {Neuron encodes and transmits information through generating sequences of output spikes, which is a high energy-consuming process. The spike is initiated when membrane depolarization reaches a threshold voltage. In many neurons, threshold is dynamic and depends on the rate of membrane depolarization (dV/dt) preceding a spike. Identifying the metabolic energy involved in neural coding and their relationship to threshold dynamic is critical to understanding neuronal function and evolution. Here, we use a modified Morris-Lecar model to investigate neuronal input-output property and energy efficiency associated with different spike threshold dynamics. We find that the neurons with dynamic threshold sensitive to dV/dt generate discontinuous frequency-current curve and type II phase response curve (PRC) through Hopf bifurcation, and weak noise could prohibit spiking when bifurcation just occurs. The threshold that is insensitive to dV/dt, instead, results in a continuous frequency-current curve, a type I PRC and a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation, and simultaneously weak noise cannot inhibit spiking. It is also shown that the bifurcation, frequency-current curve and PRC type associated with different threshold dynamics arise from the distinct subthreshold interactions of membrane currents. Further, we observe that the energy consumption of the neuron is related to its firing characteristics. The depolarization of spike threshold improves neuronal energy efficiency by reducing the overlap of Na+ and K+ currents during an action potential. The high energy efficiency is achieved at more depolarized spike threshold and high stimulus current. These results provide a fundamental biophysical connection that links spike threshold dynamics, input-output relation, energetics and spike initiation, which could contribute to uncover neural encoding mechanism.},

Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the 1D responses of grid cells with stable 1D fields are consistent with a linear slice through a 2D triangular lattice. Further, the 1D responses of comodular cells are well described by parallel slices, and the offsets in the starting points of the 1D slices can predict the measured 2D relative spatial phase between the cells. From these results, we conclude that the 2D dynamics of these cells is preserved in 1D, suggesting a common computation during both types of navigation behavior.},

  abstract = {Objective: An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyrus, CA fields 1 - 3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions. Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents. This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure segmentation protocol.
Method: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of agreement.
Results: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and tail.
Conclusions: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between published studies.},

  abstract = {The putative excitatory and inhibitory cell classes within the mouse primary visual cortexV1 have different functional properties as studied using recording microelectrode. Excitatory neurons show high selectivity for the orientation angle of moving gratings while the putative inhibitory neurons show poor selectivity. However, the study of selectivity of the genetically identified interneurons and their subtypes remain controversial. Here we use novel Cre-driver and reporter mice to identify genetic subpopulations in vivo for two-photon calcium dye imaging: Wfs1(+)/Gad1(-) mice that labels layer 2/3 excitatory cell population and Pvalb(+)/Gad1(+) mice that labels a genetic subpopulation of inhibitory neurons.The cells in both mice were identically labeled with a tdTomato protein, visible in vivo, using a Cre-reporter line. We found that the Wfs1(+) cells exhibited visual tuning properties comparable to the excitatory population, i.e., high selectivity and tuning to the angle, direction, and spatial frequency of oriented moving gratings.The functional tuning of Pvalb(+) neurons was consistent with previously reported narrow-spiking interneurons in microelectrode studies, exhibiting poorer selectivity than the excitatory neurons. This study demonstrates the utility of Cre-transgenic mouse technology in selective targeting of subpopulations of neurons and makes them amenable to structural, functional, and connectivity studies.},

  abstract = {In hippocampal area CA1 of rats, the frequency of gamma activity has been shown to increase with running speed (Ahmed and Mehta, 2012). This finding suggests that different gamma frequencies simply allow for different timings of transitions across cell assemblies at varying running speeds, rather than serving unique functions. However, accumulating evidence supports the conclusion that slow (\textasciitilde{}25\textendash{}55 Hz) and fast (\textasciitilde{}60\textendash{}100 Hz) gamma are distinct network states with different functions. If slow and fast gamma constitute distinct network states, then it is possible that slow and fast gamma frequencies are differentially affected by running speed. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that slow and fast gamma frequencies change differently as a function of running speed in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Fast gamma frequencies increased with increasing running speed in all three areas. Slow gamma frequencies changed significantly less across different speeds. Furthermore, at high running speeds, CA3 firing rates were low, and MEC firing rates were high, suggesting that CA1 transitions from CA3 inputs to MEC inputs as running speed increases. These results support the hypothesis that slow and fast gamma reflect functionally distinct states in the hippocampal network, with fast gamma driven by MEC at high running speeds and slow gamma driven by CA3 at low running speeds.

  abstract = {Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons constitute a major neuromodulatory system implicated in normal cognition and neurodegenerative dementias. Cholinergic projections densely innervate neocortex, releasing acetylcholine to regulate arousal, attention, and learning. However, their precise behavioral function is poorly understood because identified cholinergic neurons have never been recorded during behavior. To determine which aspects of cognition their activity might support, we recorded cholinergic neurons using optogenetic identification in mice performing an auditory detection task requiring sustained attention. We found that a non-cholinergic basal forebrain population\textemdash{}but not cholinergic neurons\textemdash{}were correlated with trial-to-trial measures of attention. Surprisingly, cholinergic neurons responded to reward and punishment with unusual speed and precision (18 {$\pm$} 3 ms). Cholinergic responses were scaled by the unexpectedness of reinforcement and were highly similar across neurons and two nuclei innervating distinct cortical areas. These results reveal that the cholinergic system broadcasts a rapid and precisely timed reinforcement signal, supporting fast cortical activation and plasticity.},

  issn = {1050-9631, 1098-1063},
  abstract = {The factors that control the spatial tuning of hippocampal neurons are incompletely understood, and there is no generally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a ``place field''. One factor that must be considered is the phenomenon of ``phase precession''. As a rat passes through the place field of a particular hippocampal neuron, its spikes shift to earlier phases of the theta rhythm. Except for the special cases discussed herein, the phase shift never exceeds 3608. Moreover, under conditions in which place field sizes change dynamically, precession rate is tightly coupled with the place field size, suggesting that a single cycle of theta phase precession could be used to define unitary place field boundaries. Theta phase precession implies that the ``cell assembly'' of active hippocampal neurons changes systematically over the course of a single theta cycle. A given cell can exhibit more than one place field in a given environment, each field showing the same pattern of 3608 of phase precession. The existence of multiple fields implies that one cell can participate in multiple cell assemblies within the same environment. We show here that place fields, defined as a single cycle of phase precession, can overlap spatially, with the result that the cell fires with spikes clustered at two different phases over the theta cycles in which the fields overlap. Thus, the same neuron can participate in different cell assemblies within a single theta cycle. VC 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {GABAergic interneurons constitute a heterogeneous group of cells that exert a powerful control on network excitability and are responsible for the oscillatory behavior crucial for information processing in the brain. These cells have been differently classified according to their morphological, neurochemical, and physiological characteristics. Here, whole cell patch clamp recordings were used to further characterize, in transgenic mice expressing EGFP in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons containing somatostatin (GIN mice), the functional properties of EGFP-positive cells in stratum oriens of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, in slice cultures obtained from P8 old animals. These cells showed passive and active membrane properties similar to those found in stratum oriens interneurons projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Moreover, they exhibited different firing patterns that were maintained upon membrane depolarization: irregular (48\%), regular (30\%), and clustered (22\%). Trains of action potentials in interneurons evoked in a minority of principal cells (3/45) small amplitude GABAergic currents that at 20 Hz underwent short-term depression. In contrast, excitatory connections between principal cells and EGFP-positive interneurons were highly reliable (17/55) and exhibited a frequency and use-dependent facilitation particularly in the gamma band. In addition, recordings from paired of interconnected EGFP-positive cells revealed in 47\% of the cases electrical coupling, which was abolished by carbenoxolone (200 lM). On average, the coupling coefficient was 0.21 6 0.07. When electrical coupling was particularly strong it acted as a powerful low-pass filter, thus contributing to alter the output of individual cells. In conclusion, it appears that the dynamic interaction between cells with various firing patterns could differently affect GABAergic signaling, leading, as suggested by simulation data, to a wide range of interneuronal communication within the hippocampal network.},

  abstract = {Two types of principal neurons, stellate cells and pyramidal-like cells, are found in medial entorhinal-cortex (mEC) layer II, and are believed to represent two distinct channels of information processing and transmission in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus network. In this study we found that depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs) that follow single action potentials (APs) evoked from various levels of holding membrane voltage (Vh) show distinct properties in the two cells types. In both, an evident DAP followed the AP at near-threshold Vh levels, and was accompanied by an enhancement of excitability and spike-timing precision. This DAP was sensitive to voltage-gated Na+-channel block with TTx, but not to partial removal of extracellular Ca2+. Application of 5-{$\mathrm{\mu}$}M anandamide, which inhibited the resurgent and persistent Na+-current components in a relatively selective way, significantly reduced the amplitude of this particular DAP while exerting poor effects on the foregoing AP. In the presence of background hyperpolarization, DAPs showed an opposite behavior in the two cell types, as in stellate cells they became even more prominent, whereas in pyramidal-like cells their amplitude was markedly reduced. The DAP observed in stellate cells under this condition was strongly inhibited by partial extracellular-Ca2+ removal, and was sensitive to the low-voltage-activated Ca2+-channel blocker, NNC55-0396. This Ca2+ dependence was not observed in the residual DAP evoked in pyramidal-like cells from likewise negative Vh levels. These results demonstrate that two distinct mechanism of DAP generation operate in mEC layer-II neurons, one Na+-dependent and active at near-threshold Vh levels in both stellate and-pyramidallike cells, the other Ca2+-dependent and only expressed by stellate cells in the presence of background membrane hyperpolarization.},

The identified genes explain 25\textendash{}35\% of cases of familial ALS, but identifying the remaining genes has proved difficult. Only a few genes seem to account for significant numbers of ALS cases, with many others causing a few cases each. Hereditary ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, and families with low disease penetrance are frequently observed. In such families, the genetic predisposition may remain unnoticed, so many patients carry a diagnosis of isolated or sporadic ALS. The only clinical feature that distinguishes recognized hereditary from apparently sporadic ALS is a lower mean age of onset in the former. All the clinical features reported in hereditary cases (including signs of extrapyramidal, cerebellar or cognitive involvement) have also been observed in sporadic cases. Genetic counseling and risk assessment in relatives depend on establishing the specific gene defect and the disease penetrance in the particular family.},

In its most general form, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis states that ``activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is induced at appropriate synapses during memory formation and is both necessary and sufficient for the information storage underlying the type of memory mediated by the brain area in which that plasticity is observed.'' We outline a set of criteria by which this hypothesis can be judged and describe a range of experimental strategies used to investigate it. We review both classical and newly discovered properties of synaptic plasticity and stress the importance of the neural architecture and synaptic learning rules of the network in which it is embedded. The greater part of the article focuses on types of memory mediated by the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. We conclude that a wealth of data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning and memory, but that little data currently supports the notion of sufficiency.},

  abstract = {Regulated exocytosis and endocytosis are critical to the function of many intercellular networks, particularly the complex neural circuits underlying mammalian behavior. Kiss-and-run (KR) is an unconventional fusion between secretory vesicles and a target membrane that releases intravesicular content through a transient, nanometer-sized fusion pore. The fusing vesicle retains its gross shape, precluding full integration into the planar membrane, and enough molecular components for rapid retrieval, reacidification, and reuse. KR makes judicious use of finite presynaptic resources, and mounting evidence suggests that it influences synaptic information transfer. Here we detail emerging perspectives on KR and its role in neurotransmission. We additionally formulate a restraining force hypothesis as a plausible mechanistic basis for KR and its physiological modulation in small nerve terminals. Clarification of the mechanism and function of KR has bearing on understanding the kinetic transitions underlying SNARE-mediated fusion, interactions between vesicles and their local environment, and the influence of release dynamics on neural information processing.},

However, neurotransmitters are also released asynchronously with a longer, variable delay following an action potential or spontaneously in the absence of action potentials. A compelling body of research has identified roles and mechanisms for synchronous release, but asynchronous release and spontaneous release are less well understood. In this review, we analyze how the mechanisms of the three release modes overlap and what molecular pathways underlie asynchronous and spontaneous release. We conclude that the modes of release have key fusion processes in common but may differ in the source of and necessity for Ca2+ to trigger release and in the identity of the Ca2+ sensor for release.},

  abstract = {Vesicle exocytosis releases content to mediate many biological events, including synaptic transmission essential for brain functions. Following exocytosis, endocytosis is initiated to retrieve exocytosed vesicles within seconds to minutes. Decades of studies in secretory cells reveal three exocytosis modes coupled to three endocytosis modes: (a) full-collapse fusion, in which vesicles collapse into the plasma membrane, followed by classical endocytosis involving membrane invagination and vesicle reformation; (b) kiss-and-run, in which the fusion pore opens and closes; and (c) compound exocytosis, which involves exocytosis of giant vesicles formed via vesicle-vesicle fusion, followed by bulk endocytosis that retrieves giant vesicles. Here we review these exo- and endocytosis modes and their roles in regulating quantal size and synaptic strength, generating synaptic plasticity, maintaining exocytosis, and clearing release sites for vesicle replenishment. Furthermore, we highlight recent progress in understanding how vesicle endocytosis is initiated and is thus coupled to exocytosis. The emerging model is that calcium influx via voltage-dependent calcium channels at the calcium microdomain triggers endocytosis and controls endocytosis rate; calmodulin and synaptotagmin are the calcium sensors; and the exocytosis machinery, including SNARE proteins (synaptobrevin, SNAP25, and syntaxin), is needed to coinitiate endocytosis, likely to control the amount of endocytosis.},

In the last 15 years, research on IK1 and IKACh has been propelled by the cloning of the underlying inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels, the discovery of the molecular mechanism of strong rectification and the linking of a number of disorders of cardiac excitability to defects in genes encoding Kir channels. Disease-causing mutations in Kir genes have been shown experimentally to affect one or more of the following channel properties: structure, assembly, trafficking, and regulation, with the ultimate effect of a gain- or a loss-of-function of the channel. It is now established that IK1 and IKACh channels are heterotetramers of Kir2 and Kir3 subunits, respectively. Each homomeric Kir channel has distinct biophysical and regulatory properties, and individual Kir subunits often display different patterns of regional, cellular, and membrane distribution. These differences are thought to underlie important variations in the physiological properties of IK1 and IKACh. It has become increasingly clear that the contribution of IK1 and IKACh channels to cardiac electrical activity goes beyond their long recognized role in the stabilization of resting membrane potential and shaping the late phase of action potential repolarization in individual myocytes but extends to being critical elements determining the overall electrical stability of the heart.},

  abstract = {The medial entorhinal cortex layer II (MEClayerII) is a brain region critical for spatial navigation and memory, and it also demonstrates a number of changes in patients with, and animal models of, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Prior studies of GABAergic microcircuitry in MEClayerII revealed that cholecystokinin-containing basket cells (CCKBCs) select their targets on the basis of the long-range projection pattern of the postsynaptic principal cell. Specifically, CCKBCs largely avoid reelincontaining principal cells that form the perforant path to the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and preferentially innervate non-perforant path forming calbindin-containing principal cells. We investigated whether parvalbumin containing basket cells (PVBCs), the other major perisomatic targeting GABAergic cell population, demonstrate similar postsynaptic target selectivity as well. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the functional or anatomic arrangement of circuit selectivity is disrupted in MEClayerII in chronic TLE, using the repeated low-dose kainate model in rats. In control animals, we found that PVBCs innervated both principal cell populations, but also had significant selectivity for calbindincontaining principal cells in MEClayerII. However, the magnitude of this preference was smaller than for CCKBCs. In addition, axonal tracing and paired recordings showed that individual PVBCs were capable of contacting both calbindin and reelin-containing principal cells. In chronically epileptic animals, we found that the intrinsic properties of the two principal cell populations, the GABAergic perisomatic bouton numbers, and selectivity of the CCKBCs and PVBCs remained remarkably constant in MEClayerII. However, miniature IPSC frequency was decreased in epilepsy, and paired recordings revealed the presence of direct excitatory connections between principal cells in the MEClayerII in epilepsy, which is unusual in normal adult MEClayerII. Taken together, these findings advance our knowledge about the organization of perisomatic inhibition both in control and in epileptic animals. VC 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We implemented a VR setup for rats, including software and large-scale electrophysiology, that supports 2D navigation by allowing rotation and walking in any direction. The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, including place, head direction, and grid cells, showed 2D activity patterns similar to those in the real world. Furthermore, border cells were observed, and hippocampal remapping was driven by environment shape, suggesting functional processing of virtual boundaries. These results illustrate that 2D spatial representations can be engaged by visual and rotational vestibular stimuli alone and suggest a novel VR tool for studying rat navigation.},

Here, we provide a detailed and quantitative analysis of the transduction profiles of rAAV vectors based on six of the most commonly used serotypes (AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8, AAV9) that allows systematic comparison and selection of the optimal vector for a specific application. In our studies we observed marked differences among serotypes in the efficiency to transduce three different brain regions namely the striatum, hippocampus and neocortex of the mouse. Despite the fact that the analyzed serotypes have the general ability to transduce all major cell types in the brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), the expression level of a reporter gene driven from a ubiquitous promoter varies significantly for specific cell type / serotype combinations. For example, rAAV8 is particularly efficient to drive transgene expression in astrocytes while rAAV9 appears well suited for the transduction of cortical neurons. Interestingly, we demonstrate selective retrograde transport of rAAV5 along axons projecting from the ventral part of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we show that selfcomplementing rAAV can be used to significantly decrease the time required for the onset of transgene expression in the mouse brain.},

Many modern concepts about the function of sodium and potassium currents are based on experiments performed in nonmammalian cells. The recent recognition of the fast delayed rectifier current indicates that we need to reevaluate the biophysical role of sodium and potassium currents. This review will consider high quality voltage clamp data obtained from the soma of central mammalian neurons in the view of our current knowledge about proteins forming ionic channels. Fast sodium currents and three types of outward potassium currents, the delayed rectifier, the subthreshold A-type, and the D-type potassium currents, are discussed here. An updated current classification with biophysical role of each current subtype is provided. This review shows that details of kinetics of both sodium and outward potassium currents differ significantly from the classical descriptions and these differences may be of functional significance.},

  abstract = {First described over a quarter of a century ago, the cardiac pacemaker bfunnyQ (If) current has been extensively characterized since, and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been thoroughly demonstrated. A similar current, termed Ih, was later described in different types of neurons, where it has a variety of functions and contributes to the control of cell excitability and plasticity. If is an inward current activated by both voltage hyperpolarization and intracellular cAMP. In the heart, as well as generating spontaneous activity, f-channels mediate autonomicdependent modulation of heart rate: h-adrenergic stimulation accelerates, and vagal stimulation slows, cardiac rate by increasing and decreasing, respectively, the intracellular cAMP concentration and, consequently, the f-channel degree of activation. Four isoforms of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have been cloned more recently and shown to be the molecular correlates of native f-channels in the heart and h-channels in the brain. Individual HCN isoforms have kinetic and modulatory properties which differ quantitatively. A comparison of their biophysical properties with those of native pacemaker channels provides insight into the molecular basis of the pacemaker current properties and, together with immunolabelling and other detection techniques, gives information on the pattern of HCN isoform distribution in different tissues. Because of their relevance to cardiac pacemaker activity, f-channels are a natural target of drugs aimed at the pharmacological control of heart rate. Several agents developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate act by a specific inhibition of f-channel function; these substances have a potential for the treatment of diseases such as angina and heart failure. In the near future, devices based on the delivery of f-channels in situ, or of a cellular source of f-channels (biological pacemakers), will likely be developed for use in therapies for diseases of heart rhythm with the aim of replacing electronic pacemakers.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) is an adrenal steroid hormone that controls a variety of physiological processes such as metabolism, immune response, cardiovascular activity, and brain function. In addition to GC induction in response to stress, even in relatively undisturbed states its circulating level is subjected to a robust daily variation with a peak around the onset of the active period of the day. It has long been believed that the synthesis and secretion of GC are primarily regulated by the hypothalamus\textendash{}pituitary\textendash{}adrenal (HPA) neuroendocrine axis. However, recent chronobiological research strongly supports the idea that multiple regulatory mechanisms along with the classical HPA neuroendocrine axis underlie the diurnal rhythm of circulating GC. Most notably, recent studies demonstrate that the molecular circadian clockwork is heavily involved in the daily GC rhythm at multiple levels. The daily GC rhythm is implicated in various human diseases accompanied by abnormal GC levels. Patients with such diseases frequently show a blunted GC rhythmicity and, more importantly, circadian rhythm-related symptoms. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of the circadian regulation of adrenal GC and its implications in human health and disease.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors that associate with DNA sequences in promoters and enhancers often recruit co-regulators that modulate their activity. Many of these co-regulators have intrinsic enzymatic activity and influence gene expression by modifying chromatin and altering its structure. Recently, a new family of co-repressors, the C-terminal binding proteins, has been described. These proteins recognize Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser (PXDLS) motifs in DNA-binding proteins and function as transcriptional corepressors in Drosophila, Xenopus and mammals. The precise mechanisms by which they influence transcription are still under investigation. CtBP proteins dimerize and can contact histone deacetylases; hence they may operate by linking deacetylases to DNA-bound factors. But it appears that CtBP proteins also have intrinsic enzymatic activity. They have significant homology to D-isomer-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, and remarkably one family member, rat CtBP, has been shown to have a second role, functioning as an acyl transferase in Golgi maintenance. These observations raise the possibility that CtBP proteins might regulate gene expression directly by means of their enzymatic activities, in addition to serving as simple bridging proteins.

  title = {{{HPA}} Axis Dysregulation in Mice Overexpressing Corticotropin Releasing Hormone},
  volume = {51},
  issn = {00063223},
  abstract = {Background: Hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the brain has been implicated in stress-related human pathologies. We developed a transgenic mouse line overexpressing CRH (CRH-OE) exclusively in neural tissues to assess the effect of long-term CRH overproduction on regulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
Methods: Male transgenic CRH-OE2122 mice on a C57BL/6J background were used. Littermate wildtype mice served as control animals. Basal plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations were measured, and adrenal gland weight was determined. A dexamethasone suppression test measured the effects of long-term CRH hypersecretion on negative feedback control. Additionally, we measured plasma corticosterone concentrations in reaction to stress.
Results: CRH-OE2122 mice showed elevated basal plasma corticosterone concentrations, hypertrophy of the adrenal gland, and dexamethasone nonsuppression. Basal plasma ACTH concentrations of wildtype and CRH-OE2122 mice did not differ significantly. In reaction to stress, CRHOE2122 mice showed a normal corticosterone response.
Conclusions: The HPA axis abnormalities observed in CRH-OE2122 mice suggest that long-term hypersecretion of CRH in the brain can be a main cause of HPA axis dysregulation. The alterations in HPA axis regulation are reminiscent of changes reported in major depressive disorder. As such, these CRH -OE2122 mice may model the neuroendocrine changes observed in major depressive disorder.

  abstract = {N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptormediated neurotoxicity may depend, in part, on the generation of nitric oxide (NO') and superoxide anion (Oi-), which react to form peroxynitrite (OONOl). This form of neurotoxicity is thought to contribute to a final common pathway of injury in a wide variety of acute and chronic neurologic disorders, including focal ischemia, trauma, epilepsy, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AIDS dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that exposure of cortical neurons to relatively short durations or low concentrations of NMDA, S-nitrosocysteine, or 3-morpholinosydnonimine, which generate low levels of peroxynitrite, induces a delayed form of neurotoxicity predominated by apoptotic features. Pretreatment with superoxide dismutase and catalase to scavenge Oi- partially prevents the apoptotic process triggered by S-nitrosocysteine or 3-morpholinosydnonimine. In contrast, intense exposure to high concentrations of NMDA or peroxynitrite induces necrotic cell damage characterized by acute swelling and lysis, which cannot be ameliorated by superoxide dismutase and catalase. Thus, depending on the intensity of the initial insult, NMDA or nitric oxide/superoxide can result in either apoptotic or necrotic neuronal cell damage.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the membrane properties and excitatory synaptic transmission of mitral cells in a slice preparation of rat olfactory bulb. In response to intracellular injection of depolarizing current, most mitral cells showed several distinct membrane properties: {\v Z}1. delayed onset of firing {\v Z}suggesting the presence of a type of potassium A current.; {\v Z}2. subthreshold oscillation of the membrane potential; and {\v Z}3. repetitive firing of clustered action potentials during prolonged threshold stimulation. Olfactory nerve {\v Z}ON. stimulation evoked a long-lasting EPSP in most of the mitral cells. This long EPSP was completely blocked by combined application of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists {\v Z}20 mM CNQX and 100 mM APV., confirming that glutamate is the neurotransmitter at the synapses from ON to mitral cells. The ON-evoked EPSP was often preceded by a prespike, which was resistant to membrane potential hyperpolarization at the soma. This fast prepotential may be indicative of an active response in the primary dendritic tufts of the mitral cells. Stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract evoked an antidromic impulse followed by a short EPSP, which could also be elicited independently of an antidromic spike in the recorded cell. Since the asymmetrical synapses so far observed on the mitral cells are all from the ON, this antidromically evoked EPSP may reflect self-excitation of a mitral cell by glutamate released from its own dendrites by antidromic impulse invasion, orrand lateral excitation by neighboring invaded dendrites.},

  abstract = {Abide its toxicity, 3,3V-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride-dihydrate (DAB) was the most potent marker for immunochemistry at the light and electron microscopic level in the last decades. Recently, a sensitive substrate for immunohistochemical staining methods and in-situ hybridization, HistoGreen, was developed for the use with peroxidase. In peroxidase reactions, HistoGreen delivers a green staining product which is suitable for permanent embedding without water. In contrast to DAB, HistoGreen is not toxic. To evaluate its usefulness, we performed comparative immunohistochemistry on angiotensin II (AT1)-receptors with DAB- and HistoGreen-staining on paraffin embedded slices of the rat brain at the light microscopic level. This also included counterstaining with Mayer's Hemalum and Nuclear Fast Red, respectively. We could demonstrate that HistoGreen delivers a coarsely grained label which is fast detectable in light microscopy. HistoGreen equals DAB in the exact localization of the immunoreaction to a large degree but its reaction product is considerably less stable in alcohol and water than DAB. In combination with Nuclear Fast Red, HistoGreen provides excellent imaging properties for the visualization and documentation of immunoreactive structures paired with an adequate demonstration of cellular details. Its tendency towards rapid overstaining as well as its low stability will restrict the use of HistoGreen in some areas of immunohistochemical research, yet the new chromogen represents an interesting alternative to DAB at the light microscopic level.},
